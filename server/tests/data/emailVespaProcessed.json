        "The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, psychedelia, experimental music, modal jazz, country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \"Deadheads\".",
        "\"Their music,\" writes Lenny Kaye, \"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\". The band was ranked 57th by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in its The Greatest Artists of All Time issue.",
        "The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and a recording of their May 8, 1977 performance at Cornell University's Barton Hall was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide."

        "For 52 years he held the record for most consecutive games with a touchdown pass (which he set between 1956 and 1960), until quarterback Drew Brees broke his long standing record on October 7, 2012. Unitas was the prototype of the modern era marquee quarterback with a strong passing game, media fanfare, and widespread popularity. He has been consistently listed as one of the greatest NFL players of all time."

The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor."

        "William Blake (28 November 1757 – 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age. What he called his prophetic works were said by 20th century critic Northrop Frye to form \"what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language\".",
        "His visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him \"far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced\". In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. Although he lived in London his entire life (except for three years spent in Felpham), he produced a diverse and symbolically rich \"œuvre\", which embraced the imagination as \"the body of God\" or \"human existence itself\"."

From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various Māori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving Māori the same rights as British subjects.",

War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from Māori to Pākehā (European) ownership, and most Māori subsequently became impoverished."

The German chancellor also turned himself to the Emperor of Austria, Franz Joseph I of Austria for help. A similar war in 1848 had got all wrong for the Prussians.",
        "With help of both the Austrians and the Danish born General Moltke was the Danish army destroyed or forced to make disordered retreat. And the Prussian - Danish border was moved from the Elbe up in Jutland to the creek \"Kongeåen \"."

At these high altitudes, the residual atmospheric gases sort into strata according to molecular mass (see turbosphere). Thermospheric temperatures increase with altitude due to absorption of highly energetic solar radiation. Temperatures are highly dependent on solar activity, and can rise to 2000 C .",

Although the exact dates of his dominance are a matter of scholarly debate, the period of 1721–42 is often used. He dominated the Walpole–Townshend ministry and the Whig government of 1730–42 and holds the record as the longest-serving Prime Minister in British history.",
        "Speck says that Walpole's uninterrupted run of 20 years as Prime Ministeris rightly regarded as one of the major feats of British political history... Explanations are usually offered in terms of his expert handling of the political system after 1720, [and] his unique blending of the surviving powers of the crown with the increasing influence of the Commons.He was a Whig from the gentry class, who was first elected to Parliament in 1701, and held many senior positions.",
        "He was a country squire and looked to country gentlemen for his political base. Historian Frank O'Gorman says his leadership in Parliament reflected his \"reasonable and persuasive oratory, his ability to move both the emotions as well as the minds of men, and, above all, his extraordinary self-confidence.\" Hoppit says Walpole's policies sought moderation: he worked for peace, lower taxes, growing exports, and allowed a little more tolerance for Protestant Dissenters.",
        "He avoided controversy and high-intensity disputes, as his middle way attracted moderates from both the Whig and Tory camps."

        "The Police were an English new wave band formed in London in 1977. For most of their history the band consisted of Sting (lead vocals, bass guitar, primary songwriter), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums, percussion). The Police became globally popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s and are generally regarded as one of the first new-wave groups to achieve mainstream success, playing a style of rock influenced by punk, reggae, and jazz.",

        "A mermaid is a legendary aquatic creature with the head and upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings.",
        "In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans."

Takeda had extensive training in several martial arts (including Kashima Shinden Jikishinkage-ryū and sumo) and referred to the style he taught as \"Daitō-ryū\" (literally, \"Great School\").",

Whether Takeda is regarded as either the restorer or the founder of the art, the known history of Daitō-ryū begins with him. Takeda's best-known student was Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of aikido."

Doo-wop features vocal group harmony, nonsense syllables, a simple beat, sometimes little or no instrumentation, and simple music and lyrics."

        "The Regency in Great Britain was a period when King George III was deemed unfit to rule and his son ruled as his proxy as Prince Regent. On the death of George III in 1820, the Prince Regent became George IV. The term Regency (or Regency era) can refer to various stretches of time; some are longer than the decade of the formal Regency which lasted from 1811–1820.",
        "The period from 1795 to 1837, which includes the latter part of the reign of George III and the reigns of his sons George IV and William IV, is often regarded as the Regency era, characterised by distinctive trends in British architecture, literature, fashions, politics, and culture. The Regency era ended in 1837 when Queen Victoria succeeded William IV."

He first rose to prominence during his college football career at Boston College, where he received the Heisman Trophy and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award in 1984.",
        "His \"Hail Flutie\" touchdown pass in a game against Miami on November 23, 1984 (dubbed \"The Pass\") is considered among the greatest moments in college football and American sports history. Flutie was selected as the 285th pick in the 11th round of the 1985 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams, making him the lowest drafted Heisman Award winner among those who were drafted.",
        "Flutie played that year for the New Jersey Generals of the upstart USFL, having already signed a five-year $5 million contract with them prior to being drafted by the Rams. In 1986, he signed with the NFL's Chicago Bears, and later played for the New England Patriots, becoming their starting quarterback in 1988."

Cain, the firstborn, tilled the soil, and his brother Abel was a shepherd. The brothers made sacrifices to God, each of his own produce, but God favored Abel's sacrifice instead of Cain's. Cain murdered Abel. God punished Cain to a life of wandering, but set a mark on him so that no man would kill him.",

The narrative never explicitly states Cain's motive (though it does describe him as being wrathful, and his motive is traditionally assumed to be envy), nor God's reason for rejecting Cain's sacrifice, nor details on the identity of Cain's wife. Some traditional interpretations consider Cain to be the originator of evil, violence, or greed."

In a jack-o'-lantern, the top of the pumpkin or turnip is cut off to form a lid, the inside flesh is scooped out, and an image — usually a monstrous or comical face – is carved out of the rind to expose the hollow interior.",
        "To create the lantern effect, a light source is placed within before the lid is closed. The light source is traditionally a flame such as a candle or tea light, but artificial jack-'o-lanterns with electric lights are also marketed. It is common to see jack-o'-lanterns on doorsteps and otherwise used as decorations prior to and on Halloween."

She was blacklisted after her appearance before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) at the height of the anti-communist campaigns of 1947–52. Although she continued to work on Broadway in the 1950s, her blacklisting by the American film industry caused a drop in her income.",

He is considered to have revolutionized Venetian painting, moving it towards a more sensuous and colouristic style.",

        "The Connecticut Sun are a professional women's basketball team based in Uncasville, Connecticut that competes in the Eastern Conference of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). Along with the Minnesota Lynx, the club was established in 1999 as part of the league's expansion from ten to twelve teams. The Miracle, the club's previous moniker, originated that year in Orlando, Florida, as the sister team to the NBA's Orlando Magic.",
        "Financial straits left the Miracle teetering on the brink of disbanding before the Mohegan Indian tribe purchased and relocated the team to Mohegan Sun, becoming the first Native American tribe to own a professional sports franchise. The derivative of the club's name comes from its affiliation with Mohegan Sun, while the team's logo is reflective of a modern interpretation of an ancient Mohegan symbol."

Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as \"The Sound\" because of his warm, lyrical tone, his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as \"one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists\". Getz performed in bebop and cool jazz groups.",

        "In Tagalog mythology, Mayari (also known as Bulan) is the beautiful and most charming lunar deity who was the daughter of Bathala, the king of the gods, to a mortal woman. Mayari is the Goddess of Combat, War, Revolution, Hunt, Weaponry, Beauty, Strength, Moon and Night. She is known as the most beautiful deity in Bathala's court. She is the sister of Tala, the goddess of stars and Adlaw (also known as Apolaki), god of the sun. However, in some mythology, Tala is Mayari's daughter."

        "Imaginary friends (also known as pretend friends or invisible friends) are a psychological and social phenomenon where a friendship or other interpersonal relationship takes place in the imagination rather than external physical reality. Although they may seem very real to their creators, children usually understand that their imaginary friends are not real. The first studies focusing on imaginary friends are believed to have been conducted during the 1890s.",
        "There is little information about the development and the appearance of imaginary friends in children. However, Klausen & Passman (2007) report that imaginary companions were originally described as being supernatural creatures and spirits that were thought to connect people with their past lives. Adults in early historic times had entities such as household gods and guardian angels, and muses that functioned as imaginary companions to provide comfort, guidance and inspiration for creative work.",
        "Eventually the phenomenon of imaginary companions passed on to children. The era when children began having imaginary friends is unknown, but it is possible the phenomenon appeared in the mid–20th century when childhood was emphasized as an important time to play and imagine."

Stephen Fry was host of the show from its initial pilot, before departing after the final episode of the M series in 2015, with frequent \"QI\" panelist Sandi Toksvig replacing him prior to the beginning of the N series in 2016.",
        "The format of the show focuses on Davies and three other guest panelists answering questions that are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given.",
        "To compensate, the panelists are awarded points not only for the right answer, but also for interesting ones, regardless of whether they are right or even relate to the original question, while points are deducted for \"answers which are not only wrong, but pathetically obvious\" – typically answers that are generally believed to be true but in fact are misconceptions.",
        "These answers, referred to as \"forfeits\", are usually indicated by a loud klaxon and alarm bell, flashing lights, and the incorrect answer being flashed on the video screens behind the panelists. Bonus points are sometimes awarded or deducted for challenges or incorrect references, varying from show to show. \"QI\" has a philosophy that \"everything is interesting if looked at in the right way\"; many factual errors in the show have been corrected in later episodes or on the show's blog."

Following 14 years of effort, the observatory was launched from Space Shuttle \"Atlantis\" during STS-37 on April 5, 1991, and operated until its deorbit on June 4, 2000.",
        "It was deployed in low earth orbit at 450 km to avoid the Van Allen radiation belt. It was the heaviest astrophysical payload ever flown at that time at 17000 kg ."

The film takes a critical look at the presidency of George W. Bush, the War on Terror, and its coverage in the media. In the film, Moore contends that American corporate media were \"cheerleaders\" for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and did not provide an accurate or objective analysis of the rationale for the war or the resulting casualties there."

Their debut album, \"One Touch\", was released in the UK through London Records on 27 November 2000. The album achieved moderate success, peaking at number 26 in April 2001 and eventually being certified Gold. In 2001, Donaghy departed the group amid rumours of a rift with Buchanan and the group were dropped by their record label.",
        "With the introduction of Heidi Range, former member of fellow English girl group Atomic Kitten, the group began to experience a higher level of commercial success whilst keeping the critical acclaim they had achieved with their debut album. They released three studio albums before Buena announced her departure in December 2005, leading to Amelle Berrabah being brought in to replace her. Following the release of their first greatest hits album, the new line-up released two studio albums.",
        "In September 2009, after 11 years in the Sugababes, Buchanan, the final original member, was replaced by former UK Eurovision entry Jade Ewen. Range, Berrabah and Ewen released the group's seventh studio album, \"Sweet 7\", in 2010, after which they signed to RCA Records, before announcing an indefinite hiatus in 2011. In 2013, Ewen confessed that the Sugababes had split two years earlier. The original line-up of the band reformed in 2011, under the new name Mutya Keisha Siobhan."

Throughout the course of the novel, he demonstrates that he already has the brains he seeks and is later recognized as \"the wisest man in all of Oz,\" although he continues to credit the Wizard for them.",
        "He is, however, wise enough to know his own limitations and all too happy to hand the rulership of Oz, passed to him by the Wizard, to Princess Ozma, to become one of her trusted advisors, though he typically spends more time playing games than advising."

He is the son of legendary supercouple, Luke and Laura Spencer, played by Anthony Geary and Genie Francis. His birth having been announced on-screen in 1985, a ten-year-old Lucky was cast in 1993, played by newcomer at the time, Jonathan Jackson. Jackson left the series in 1999, and the character was played by Jacob Young and later Greg Vaughan, who was let go in 2009 to allow Jackson to reprise the role.",
        "Lucky's characterization changed throughout the different portrayers; originally a street-smart con artist, Lucky develops an edge during Young's tenure and more drastically changes during Vaughan's portrayal, as Lucky becomes a struggling police officer. With Jackson's reprisal, Lucky begins showing some of the character's original quick-witted qualities, but after a series of harrowing storylines, Jackson left the series in December 2011 and the role was not recast.",
        "Jackson briefly reprised the role in July 2015."

As is suggested by the name, the opera is based upon Greek mythology as told by Roman poet Ovid in his masterwork \"Metamorphoses\". Interpreting this work, Rufinus Widl wrote the libretto in Latin."

TIROS was the first satellite that was capable of remote sensing of the Earth, enabling scientists to view the Earth from a new perspective: space. The program, promoted by Harry Wexler, proved the usefulness of satellite weather observation, at a time when military reconnaissance satellites were secretly in development or use.",
        "TIROS demonstrated at that time that \"the key to genius is often simplicity.\" TIROS is an acronym of \"Television InfraRed Observation Satellite\" and is also the plural of \"tiro\" which means \"a young soldier, a beginner\"."

        "Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, also known under his literary pseudonym Eleuter (20 February 1894 – 2 March 1980), was a Polish poet, essayist, dramatist and writer. He is mostly recognized for his literary achievements in poetry before World War II, but also criticized as a long-term political opportunist in communist Poland, actively participating in the slander of Czesław Miłosz and other expatriates. He was removed from school textbooks soon after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc."

        "An Essay on Criticism is one of the first major poems written by the English writer Alexander Pope (1688–1744).",
        "It is the source of the famous quotations \"To err is human, to forgive divine,\" \"A little learning is a dang'rous thing\" (frequently misquoted as \"A little knowledge is a dang'rous thing\"), and \"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\" It first appeared in 1711 after having been written in 1709, and it is clear from Pope's correspondence that many of the poem's ideas had existed in prose form since at least 1706.",
        "Composed in heroic couplets (pairs of adjacent rhyming lines of iambic pentameter) and written in the Horatian mode of satire, it is a verse essay primarily concerned with how writers and critics behave in the new literary commerce of Pope's contemporary age. The poem covers a range of good criticism and advice, and represents many of the chief literary ideals of Pope's age."

        "Girls Town is a 1959 film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, starring Mamie Van Doren, Mel Tormé and Ray Anthony. Paul Anka also appears in his first acting role. Van Doren stars as a juvenile delinquent who is sent to a girls school run by nuns, where she finds herself unable to help her sister. The film capitalizes on the 1950s rebellious teen exploitation films, with catfights, car races, music from Anka and The Platters, and sexy outfits."

The album was originally set for a November 2006 release in the UK, however it was later pushed back to 4 December 2006. Much like her previous album, \"Free Me\", the album experiments with elements of 1960s pop music. For this particular album the musical arrangement was more directed towards 1960s French pop music, with some elements of British 1960s pop and Motown."

In the north of the bay, near Marazion, is St Michael's Mount; the origin of name of the bay. Though it looks to summer visitors like a large, benign, scenic, natural harbour, in an onshore winter gale it presents a great danger to shipping and a \"maritime trap\", especially for sailing ships.",
        "There are more than 150 known wrecks from the nineteenth century in the area. The eastern side of the bay centred around Marazion and St Michael's Mount was designated as a Marine Conservation Zone in January 2016."

        "Big Top Record Distributors also distributed Paul Case's Dunes Records label in the early 60's, which had hits from Ray Peterson (\"Corrina, Corrina\") and Curtis Lee (\"Pretty Little Angel Eyes\"), both records produced by Phil Spector. Bell Records briefly distributed Bigtop prior to the label closing, around 1965. \"Bigtop\" also released two Mad Magazine music parody themed albums; \"Mad Twists Rock 'N' Roll\" and \"Fink Along With Mad\" in 1963."

The drawing of the clipper ship \"Cutty Sark\" on the label of the whisky bottles is a work of the Swedish artist Carl Georg August Wallin. He was a mariner painter, and this is probably his most famous ship painting. This drawing has been on the whisky bottles since 1955.",
        "The Tall Ships' Races for large sailing ships were originally known as The Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Races, under the terms of sponsorship by the whisky brand."

Players have 14 or 16 tiles initially and take turns putting down tiles from their racks into sets (groups or runs) of at least three, drawing a tile if they cannot play.",

        "Resident Evil – Code: Veronica, known in Japan as Biohazard – Code: Veronica, is a survival horror video game developed and published by Capcom and originally released for the Dreamcast in 2000. It is the fourth major installment in the \"Resident Evil\" series and the first to debut outside a Sony PlayStation platform. The story takes place three months after the events of \"Resident Evil 2\" (1998) and the concurrent destruction of Raccoon City as seen in \"\" (1999).",
        "It follows Claire Redfield and her brother Chris Redfield in their efforts to survive a viral outbreak at both a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean and a research facility in Antarctica. The game retains the traditional survival horror controls and gameplay seen in previous series installments; however, unlike the pre-rendered backgrounds of previous games, \"Code: Veronica\" utilizes real-time 3D environments and dynamic camera movement."

The group was noted as early practitioners of heavy metal and progressive rock, they also incorporated elements of jazz and fusion into their music, especially in their fourth album \"Banquet\" of 1974.",
        "Beyond heavy metal, the band has been cited, too, as one of the pioneers of doom metal, helping to define both genres due to their heavy sound and dark oriented lyrics of their acclaimed debut \"Lucifer's Friend\" of 1970, and returning to their roots in 1981 with \"Mean Machine\", although more influenced by speed metal."

Clark Kissinger, Conrad Lynn, Sonia Sanchez, Rev. Fernando Santillana, and other activists who were concerned that the American government, epitomized by U.S. President Ronald Reagan, advocated a far right-wing political program directed against the political rights of its people.",

The organization's national office was located in New York City, with chapters at various times in Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Honolulu, Hawaii; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area. The organization officially dissolved in 2006. At that time, the national office closed, and the organization's files transferred to the Tamiment Library at New York University."

        "Keikogi (稽古着 or 稽古衣 ) or dōgi (道着 ) is a uniform for training, used in martial arts derived from Japan, or budō. (\"Keiko\" means practice, \"gi\" means dress or clothes.) The prototype for the modern keikogi emerged in the late 19th century. The keikogi was developed by judo founder Kanō Jigorō. Japanese martial arts historian Dave Lowry speculates Kanō derived the uniform's design from the uniforms of Japanese firefighters' heavy hemp jackets called \"hanten\".",
        "By 1920, the keikogi as it exists today was worn by Kanō's students for judo practice. The Kodokan (judo headquarters) has a photo taken in 1920 that shows Kanō wearing a modern keikogi."

The chapters alternate between James McBride's descriptions of his early life and first-person accounts of his mother Ruth's life, mostly taking place before her son was born.",
        "McBride depicts the conflicting emotions that he endured as he struggled to discover who he truly was, as his mother narrates the hardships that she had to overcome as a white, Jewish woman who chose to marry a black man in 1942."

It is a point of conjecture among historians whether James Cook, the famous navigator, ever lived in the house, but almost certainly he visited his parents at the house."

The belief is that when all the ducks are hunted out, there will no longer be any duck-oil available in the world.",
        "At this point, Amala dies and the world topples off the pole and comes to an end."

        "The Minuteman Civil Defense Corps is a volunteer group headed by Chris Simcox and dedicated to preventing illegal crossings of the United States border. Arguing that the government is insufficiently concerned with securing the U.S. border, they have organized several state chapters, with the intention of providing law enforcement agencies with evidence of immigration law violations. Simcox states that the group merely reports incidents to law enforcement, and does not directly confront immigrants.",
        "There is a standard operating procedure (SOP) that must be followed by Minutemen volunteers. Rules include not speaking to, approaching, gesturing towards or having physical contact in any way with any suspected border crossers they may see. The organization has been criticized as being a right-wing militia. The MCDC is often confused with or thought to be affiliated with The Minuteman Project Inc., but the two groups are wholly distinct. The group was originally co-founded by American neo-Nazi, J. T.",

        "The Rensselaer Plateau is a small plateau located in the central portion of Rensselaer County, New York; it generally encompasses significant parts of the towns of Berlin, Stephentown, Sand Lake, Poestenkill, and Grafton, along with small sections of several other nearby towns. Many glacial lakes, including Big Bowman Pond, Little Bowman Pond, Round Pond and Spring Lake are located on the plateau. Elevations on the plateau range from 1,000 to 2,000 feet (305 to 610 meters) above sea level.",
        "Vegetation on the plateau is more similar to that found in the Adirondack Mountains to the northwest, with abundant Eastern White Pine, Eastern Hemlock, Red Spruce, and Balsam Fir, along with more limited occurrences of Red Pine and Tamarack. While most to all of the plateau was logged late in the 19th Century and early in the 20th Century, little farming was undertaken afterwards due to extremely poor and rocky soils, allowing much of the forest to regenerate."

        "The Bolla (also known as Bullar in South Albania), is a type of demonic-serpent like Dragon from Albanian folklore with a long, coiled, serpentine body, four legs, small wings, and silver, faceted eyes. This dragon sleeps throughout the whole year, only to wake on Saint George's Day, where it peers into the world until it sees a human. It devours the person, then closes its eyes and sleeps again. This is explained in the legend of Saint George.",
        "When he fought and vanquished the dragon, Saint George cursed the beast so that it be forever blind and only open its eyes on his day only. The Bolla can change into a Kulshedra should it live many years without being seen by a human. It is etymologically related to Greek Φάλη, Φάλαινα 'monster, whale,' (although the relationship is not certain) and comes from the Latin chersydrusus which means something like ‘the snake that lives in the water and on the earth’."

        "Dog Eat Dog is the 12th album by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, released in 1985. It was her second album for Geffen Records. The album was a departure for Mitchell due to its synthetic sound (featuring production work by British synthesiser musician Thomas Dolby). Lyrically, the album dealt with prominent issues in mid 1980s society, such as Reaganism, televangelists, consumerism and famine in Ethiopia.",
        "One of Mitchell's more unusual songs, \"Smokin' (Empty, Try Another)\" was recorded by sampling the sound of the cigarette machine in the hall of the studio where \"Wild Things Run Fast\" was recorded. \"Good Friends\" was recorded as a duet with Michael McDonald; a video was produced for the song using film animation by Jim Blashfield.",
        "\"Shiny Toys\" and \"Good Friends\" were released as singles; \"Shiny Toys\" was also released in a 12\" Extended Dance Single format, remix by François Kevorkian, and had a more complete lyric than the album version, featuring spoken voice by Thomas Dolby (\"I LOVE being out on the golf course!\")."

The song was written by La La and produced by Kashif. When La La sent Kashif a copy of the song, originally offered to Roberta Flack, he thought it would be a better fit for Houston and told Arista he would be interested in recording with Houston.",
        "The song garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, but brought Houston a bit of notoriety when it turned up among several songs cited by advice columnist Ann Landers as having suggestive titles."

Some fuzzy photographs were even taken, but they were all inconclusive.",

The cow became known as a sort of \"Loch Ness Monster\" of New Jersey and believed to be a myth, much like the Jersey Devil."

It was played by rolling disc-shaped stones across the ground and throwing spears at them in an attempt to place the spear as close to the stopped stone as possible. It originated around 600 CE in the Cahokia region of what is now the United States (near modern St. Louis, Missouri).",
        "Chunkey was played in huge arenas as large as 47 acres (19 ha) that housed great audiences designed to bring people of the region together (i.e. Cahokians, farmers, immigrants, and even visitors). It continued to be played after the fall of the Mississippian culture around 1500 CE. Variations were played throughout North America. Early ethnographer James Adair translated the name to mean \"running hard labor\".",
        "Gambling was frequently connected with the game, with some players wagering everything they owned on the outcome of the game. Losers were even known to commit suicide."
