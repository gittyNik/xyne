        "The crazy level at which African countries import things was reiterated by the president of Zimbabwe, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, while addressing the delegates at the Southern African Confederation of Agricultural Unions (SACAU) annual meeting in Victoria Falls.",
        "Hear him: ‘it is regrettable that African countries spend between $30 billion and $50billion annually on imports of agricultural products, instead of developing the productive capacities necessary for trade’.According to the United Nations’ 2015 World Population Prospect Report, 2.4 billion people are projected to be added to the global population between 2015 and 2050, with 1.3 billion in Africa alone.",
        "Which means by 2050, Africa will house more than half of the world’s population and as at now no preparation is being made on how it will feed its 1.3 billion population by 2050. What about the now? 2050 is still some years ahead; what are the African leaders doing to stop, or at least, reduce the importation of finished agricultural products. Currently, Africa is still unable to feed itself and depends on importation of products to feed its people.",
        "What will happen by 2050, if a stop is not put to this trend?The potential for growth in Sustainable Agriculture in Africa is well understood, but has not been realised. Currently, the agro-allied industry (in primary processing) accounts for nearly half of all economic the activity in sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the continent spends $30bn to $50bn each year importing food and still has significant food risk and nutritional deficiencies in many parts of the region.",
        "This is despite the fact that the continent holds much of the world’s potential agricultural land (Africa has 65% of the world arable land).According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (UN FAO), Africa spends $35 billion in importing food, and it is projected that the number will grow to $110 billion by 2025.",
        "Africa is importing what it should be producing, creating poverty within the region and consequently creating jobs for the people in other continents while its people lack opportunities.It is interesting to note that African countries import numerous agricultural products which are also, ironically, produced locally.",
        "The rise of imports for these Agricultural products has been attributed to the inability to produce enough to satisfy growing local demand, due to low yields and relatively low levels of productivity.",
        "Furthermore, over 80% of Africa’s agricultural products are being produced by smallholder farmers who produce 70% of the continent’s food supply, according to FAO.Taking a look at Agricultural exports, one discovers that African countries mainly export cocoa, edible fruit and nuts, coffee and tea and vegetables to the rest of the world.",
        "The main agricultural importing countries of the African export are the United States, China, Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom.African countries do not feature under the top supplying countries for any of these markets. If Africa is serious about changing from agricultural product importers, then addressing the following issues are of paramount importance: innovation in production technology, the cost of inputs (energy and fertilisers), management of changes in climatic conditions (e.g.",
        "access to water through irrigation), knowledge transfer and capacity building, investment in agriculture and agriculture-related infrastructure (credit facilities, transportation networks, cold-storage facilities and communication networks) and access to information.ALSO READ: Questions on Nigeria’s 2017 BudgetGovernments and leaders in Africa (past and present) should (have) know(n) in importing food is a serious minus for the leadership of the component countries in Africa.Agriculture is also a major component for Africa becoming an industrialised continent, in the sense that its raw materials are needed in production of other commodities.",
        "Africa has come of age and its agricultural practices should be driven by research, mechanisation and modern technology to steer it away from remaining rudimentary.Becoming. All those foreign long sleeved shirts, locally made agbadas and tunics need to be rolled up for work; the continent cannot remain hungry when there are seeds, lands and technology around.APRECON"

Having sold 10.8 million copies, it's the 14th-best-selling album in the history of SoundScan. But sales figures aside, it was Em stepping into the prime of his career.",
        "It was a lightning rod for controversy in the year 2000 when CD sales hit their all time peak. At a time when the Billboard charts were dominated by squeaky-clean pop acts like 'N Sync and Backstreet Boys, Eminem offered a rebuttal to the hypocritical American mainstream that criticizes rap music while celebrating—and, worse, commercializing—sex, violence, and bigotry in other arenas. This album turned Eminem into a global icon.",
        "There was a huge amount of hype and controversy around it—culminating when he performed \"Stan\" at the 2001 Grammys alongside Elton John. But none of that takes away from its musical achievement. This album definitively proved that the Detroit rapper was a gifted lyricist, a brilliant songwriter, and a visionary artist.In many ways, MMLP picked up where his previous album, The Slim Shady LP, left off—many of the new songs mirrorred older ones.",
        "There's another \"Public Service Announcement\" (once again voiced by Jeff Bass of The Bass Brothers), Em calls \"Drug Ballad\" his \"love song\" the way he called \"Cum On Everybody\" his \"dance song,\" and the \"holy-shit-this-guy-is-out-of-his-fucking-mind-but-also-amazing\" song \"Kim\" is a prequel to \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde.\"The brutal honesty and specific clarity in the rhymes was striking, but Em's anger is the hallmark of this album.",
        "This is roll-your-windows-down, turn-your-system-up, throw-up-your-middle-finger-and-let-it-linger-music.Unlike his debut, however, the album got past being seen as silly or cheesy. In 1999, we didn't know what to make of this angry blonde dude because it was hard to tell when the jokes started and ended. In 2000, things became clearer as he delved further into autobiographical territory.",
        "We started to hear the seriousness in the stories about how he used to get \"beat up, peed on, be on free lunch, and changed school every three months.\"The album sounded different too. While Dr. Dre provided only three beats The Slim Shady LP, here, he and his partner Mel-Man handled most of the first half of the album, with Eminem and The Bass Brothers taking over for most of the second.",
        "Even when it came to the production credits, duality remained a running theme for Eminem (or is that Slim Shady?)The brutal honesty and specific clarity in the rhymes was striking, but Em's anger is the hallmark of this album. This is roll-your-windows-down, turn-your-system-up, throw-up-your-middle-finger-and-let-it-linger-music. Em's words are so precise and he's so in control of his pen, yet he's so emotionally erratic.",
        "(Maybe a lasting effect of his infamous Amsterdam acid trip, upon which he claims he wrote so much of the album that he considered calling it Amsterdam.)He rages against everyone; past tormentors, magazines that made fun of him (\"Double-XL, Double-XL!\"), his mother, his wife, and even manages to aim an AK at Dre's face, just because. But he's so damn good at it you hardly want to hear anyone else rapping.",
        "There isn't a long guest list, but every voice other than Em's feels like a distraction you want to fast-forward past. How could we listen to anyone else when Em was spontaneously combusting before our very ears? The rage was magnetic, hypnotic. \"Blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts!\"!!\"The anger spews in every direction as he takes reckless shots at pop culture's other famous figures.",
        "Maybe because Em was still a battle rapper at heart, one in need of a bullseye to aim his verbal darts at. He spends a lot of time lashing out at his critics, too.!!\" Lines from \"Criminal\" like \"Hate fags? The answer's yes\" are way too literal for a rapper so obsessed with weaving such an intricate web of humor and horror. And there are always lines he won't cross. One verse later he rhymes \"I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker/Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word...\" He stops there.",
        "There's still one word out there that even Eminem won't say.Despite the album's artistry and massive success, in a weird way, it's hard to call it an \"influential\" album. Sure, there are lots of white rappers today and Em certainly inspired part of that, but all of them shy away from Em comparisons. And none of them—stylistically, musically, and definitely lyrically—can hold a candle to Eminem at his peak.",
        "Really, no one of any race can compare.Bar for bar, line for line, Eminem is and always will be a rapper's rapper. But this isn't the typical \"rap\" album, it's so far removed from hip-hop's sonic center and typical subject matter. It's an Eminem album, and this is when Eminem became EMINEM. And Eminem isn't your regular rapper, not your regular pop star. He's what he's shown to be on the back cover of the album, a freak genius who likes to write raps. There he sits, Marshall, and he sits alone.",

        "Most of us have had moments when we think we are fairly unique; the main character of life’s story if you will. I was having one of these moments on Friday night when I approached the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto for a screening of Hitchcock’s classic Dial M for Murder. Surely I would be one of only a handful of cinephiles out on Friday night to catch a movie that is over 50 years old. This attitude was largely responsible for the shock I experienced when I had to scramble to find a seat.",
        "The screening must of have been sold out! Perhaps more surprising to me was the variety of people in the audience. Couples were on dates, a mother and her two teenage daughters laughed and gabbed as they found some front row seats, small packs of university students congregated at the back, and an elderly woman asked me to save her a seat in case her expedition towards the centre of the row proved fruitless.",
        "The audience was devoid of pretension and snobbery, these people were here to be entertained, and I realized, as I shed my own pretensions, so was I.I should mention that the TIFF Bell Lightbox is an amazing movie theatre. The seats are spacious and comfortable, while the cup-holders are ingenious, as they are in front of and below the armrest and completely out of the way, while still easily accessible.",
        "Also, the four screenings that I have seen have started promptly, without commercials or previews; kind of a nice change of pace considering that previews are easily accessible online these days.Dial M for Murder went off without a Hitch, if you don’t count its director.",
        "Grace Kelly was still beautiful as the delicate Margot Wendice, Ray Milland has retained his charismatically cloaked deviousness as Tony Wendice, who is in the market for a murdered wife, and my second time watching the film has given me a huge appreciation for the very humorous performance by John Williams as the infallible Chief Inspector Hubbard.The strengths of Dial M for the Murder, and the reasons why it is a classic, are the strong performances by the cast, the intelligent screenplay from Frederick Knott (based on his play of the same name), and of course, the Master of Suspense behind the camera.",
        "Rarely do plays adapted for the screen work as well as this one. The quality of Dial M for Murder is in the same league as Sleuth (1972), which is high praise from me considering Sleuth is by far my favourite film of all-time.I have trouble expressing how wonderful and fortunate Torontonians are to have a theatre like the Lightbox that is willing to screen Hitchcock classics, on actual film no less.",
        "If you grew up with Hitchcock films and want to feel nostalgic, or if you’re younger and are feeling adventurous, I urge you to get down to the Lightbox in November or December as there are some amazing Hitchock screenings ahead of us. Let the Master of Suspense show you how the old-school use to do it, before the Hollywood thriller became formulaic.

        "This will not change the moral teachings of the church.Well, of course not, and not only because the results might be different elsewhere in the world.And despite some statements by pope Francis, neither is much going to change in the official teachings of the church about the proper place of women*, though it could well be the case that your average Catholic in this country or in Germany or Switzerland might not agree with those teachings, either.I have written before about the three pillars on which the general second-class status of women depend** (religion, laws and science/pseudoscience).",
        "Out of the three it is religion which is the hardest and the slowest to change, because the holy books, written when cultures were very patriarchal, can always be interpreted as the written law of god.

        "Press ReleaseArgos Announces Issuance of Patent Covering the Foundation for Manufacturing its HIV ImmunotherapyDURHAM, N.C., Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Argos Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis® precision immunotherapy technology platform, today announced the issuance of U.S.",
        "patent 9,879,053, covering the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.The methods described in this patent form the foundation for the manufacture of AGS-004, Argos' novel, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for HIV. AGS-004 consists of autologous dendritic cells electroporated with amplified virus RNA and CD40L RNA that are designed to stimulate T cells to attack HIV-infected cells.",
        "Because HIV has a high mutation rate, viral variants are different in each patient. The methods described in this patent are used to amplify RNA encoding the unique viral variants in an individual from a small amount of blood or infectious plasma from which the virus can be isolated.",
        "This allows the generation of immunotherapies that are matched to the unique pathogen mutations in a specific individual, thus facilitating the development of a customized immunotherapy that may be more effective at controlling or eliminating the pathogen.",
        "The claims in this patent are directed to AGS-004, methods of manufacturing AGS-004 and methods of treatment utilizing AGS-004.AGS-004 is currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the latency-reversing agent vorinostat under the direction of David Margolis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and Director of the HIV Cure Center at the University of North Carolina.",
        "The latent viral reservoir consists of infected immune cells in which the HIV virus is dormant and therefore hidden from attack by the immune system. Largely because of the latent viral reservoir, currently available agents for the treatment of HIV, while able to limit the proliferation of the HIV virus, have not been successful in eradicating the virus and thus curing HIV.",
        "The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that boosting antiviral immunity with AGS-004 combined with a latency reversing drug to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system may enable eradication of the virus.\"We believe that our ability to customize the immune response to patients' unique viral variants, particularly to those variants persisting in the latent viral reservoir, offers a scientifically compelling rationale for this study,\" noted Irina Tcherepanova, Ph.D., vice president of translational medicine, Argos Therapeutics.",
        "Initial data from the ongoing clinical trial is expected during the second half the patents and patent applications owned or licensed by the Company, such as the patent referred to in this release, will protect the Company's technology and prevent others from infringing it;"

        "While the measure itself narrows down the amount of qualifying diagnoses or conditions that would qualify a patient for the therapeutic use of cannabis within the state, New York’s program was drafted with careful and strict controls that will operate under very tight regulation and oversight.Patients who are certified by a licensed healthcare practitioner to use medical marijuana in New York are required to register with the New York State Department of Health and must obtain a New York medical marijuana card, which will serve as a means of identification for the state-sanctioned patient registry.The passage of this bill makes New York the 23rd state in the country, to set the foundation for a medical marijuana program.",

        "Non-Functional Requirements in an Agile WorldAs an Agile enthusiast I’ve always rejected ‘Requirements’ as being old-school and contrary to the Agile way.",
        "However I’ve just come across Roxanne Millar’s book ‘The Quest for Software requirements: Probing questions to bring Non-functional requirements [NFRs] into focus’.While I am still a firm believer in User Stories for the functional aspect I am aware that that getting the Non-functional aspects covered effectively is vital, but rarely mentioned in Agile circles.This article refers to the Scaled methods:- Disciplined Agile [Ambler]- SAFe [SAFe].SAFe describes NFRs as “persistent qualities and constraints”.Many NFRs begin their lives as ‘Enablers’ that need to be addressed.",
        "Thereafter they constrain the system and all new Backlog items going forward.",
        "[SAFe]Mike Cohn [Cohn] believes many NFRs can fit as User stories, however, responses to his blog post present alternatives ideas.Jan Kees Velthoven [2013 – Responding to Cohn’s post] proposes an alternative format:As an [actor] I must [constraint] otherwise [fact or argument]Scott Ambler [Ambler] would call these Technical stories.In reality NFRs, including architectural implementations do not fit simply into the User story model.",
        "Some relate to a single User story / other Product Backlog Item (PBI) and may be part of the acceptance criteria, some are global; however, many relate to various subsets of the User stories. These are probably the hardest to deal with. A major error is wrongly assuming an NFR is global.Ambler would record those which are not stories or Acceptance criteria items in a list for developers and testers to manage.",
        "In this he is following the RUP concept of ‘Supplementary Requirements’ listing all NFRs.Some NFRs, once delivered, can be added to the Definition of done so that subsequent User stories conform to them. SAFe extends this concept to iterations, program increments and Releases.",
        "It defines it in the ‘SAFe Requirements model’ presenting a highly structured set of relationships between Backlog items, NFRs and System qualities tests.Surprisingly, in her book, Millar ignores Tom Gilb’s Planguage, see [Gilb], (developed over decades) which offers an excellent way of approaching metrics for NFRs, replacing the more common vague statements which stakeholders generally offer.",
        "Although SAFe states that when specifying NFRs they should be Bounded; Negotiable; Independent and Testable it fails to suggest any further level of definition of individual NFRs, at least in the material referenced below. However, it does point out that a small increment to an NFR may have a dramatic cost implication, don’t just let stakeholders assume linearity.",
        "Uptime is a good example – see [SAFe].Gilb says:“…it is essential that the explicit notion of quantification be added to agile concepts”. “Quality is Scalar, hence variable and measurable”.User stories commence life as Epics and are then further defined as they get nearer to implementation. Is this approach appropriate for NFRs too? Most NFRs can be defined with a range however this goal does not generally need to be achieved in the early stages.",
        "In the Agile world we benefit from learning and adapting as we go along, consequently NFRs should be adjusted accordingly.After defining, the NFRs need to be valued – See Shopping cart mentality in FURPS+ article [IBM].Is it necessary to define the NFRs upfront?There are some reasons why this could be of value:Gabrielle Benefield and Susan Atkinson find Gilb’s Planguage valuable in defining Agile contracts where payment should be staged and based on Business Value delivered.",
        "Adam Russell [Responding to Cohn in 2011] points out that NFRs should be identified in Business cases so that the Business can decide whether, say, a 5% increase in an NFR is actually worth the cost.Russell believes NFRs should always be expressed upfront:to start the process of focusing your attention on what qualities are valued in your target user population, and developing the team vocabulary to describe and analyse themA lot of effort could be expended on managing NFRs, however the effort should relate to the value delivered.",
        "Hence an NFR which goes up exponentially in cost as the scale is increased is worthy of a fair amount of effort!As with Functional requirements, NFRs are not completely visible at the start of a project so a framework such as FURPS+ [IBM] can be useful in scanning for them.From an Agile perspective, I would recommend that both NFRs and their metrics are regularly reviewed during planning sessions as, inevitably, more becomes known.The delivery Roadmap needs to incorporate the NFRs showing at what point each is expected to be implemented unless it is recorded as a PBI.",
        "With the Roadmap displayed on the wall everyone should be aware of the situation and it should be reviewed in each planning session.",
        "This is probably the best way of handling Ambler’s recommendation of using the Lean principle of Deferring commitmentConclusionMy conclusion is that those of us in the Agile world needs to take Non-Functional Requirements much more seriously if we want to deliver Agile effectively.References:- [Ambler] Strategies for Implementing Non-Functional Requirements- [Benefield] Lean Agile Legal Contracts for outsourcing – Gabrielle Benefield- [Cohn] Non-functional Requirements as User Stories- [Gilb] What’s Wrong With Agile Methods –Some Principles and Values to Encourage Quantification – Gilb & Brodie 2007- [IBM] Capturing Architectural Requirements IBM 2005- [SAFe] Nonfunctional Requirements Abstract"

        "I received a copy of a new book published by Packt publishing about mobile security. As mobile devices are more and more targeted by attackers, it was a good idea to publish a book on this hot topic.",
        "Written by a group of people working for IBM, the book covers a broad range of topics that can be grouped in two main sections:- A review of problems and threats affecting mobile devices- Tips and procedure to protect your mobile devicesAcross the book, the two main mobile OS are covered (iOS and Android).The first part (chapters 1 to 4) covers all the security issues that we can face when using a mobile device (and this can be extended to any “connected” device to be honest).",
        "Chapter 1 (“Living in a mobile world“) describes how our lifes changed thanks to (our “because of“) our mobile devices. We are always connected and this makes us more vulnerable to attacks. The second chapter (“Users and Mobile Device Management”) focuses on the solution and procedures that can be deployed to control mobile devices, mainly MDM solutions but also all the requirements around it: procedures, policies.",
        "Note that a “MUM” (“Mobile User Management“) could also be very useful in some cases. The third chapters reviews our privacy: “Small Word, Big consequences“. This is maybe the most interesting one. If you just have one chapter to propose to non-IT people, it’s this one! It covered all the issues that we may face regarding our privacy with a lot of references to real cases.",
        "Different types of attacks are reviewed in the next chapter: Scams, malwares, SMS spoofing, Social engineering, Phishing, Cloud computer (yes – it’s considered as a threat) and viruses.Then comes the second section with more defensive advices. the fifth chapter is called “Protecting your mobile devices“. Basically, it’s an overview of all the features implemented by a classic MDM solution: Strong passwords policies, encryption, how to use good apps, remote wiping a device.",
        "I’ve to mention some good tips covered like:- What to do in case of one of your account has been compromised?- How to create strong passwords? (honestly, nothing new)- What are the signs that a device has been compromised?The next chapter looks a bit stranger to me. It covers the support and warranty of mobile phones. I don’t see a direct relation with mobile security! Maybe some interesting advices can be found here if you’re fighting with your mobile operator or manufacturer.",
        "The most important fact to keep in mind is the gap between a device owned by a company (owned == supported) and a personal device used in your job (“BYOD“). Same idea for the chapter 7 which covers the baby boomers and teens. It reviews the impact of mobile technologies on children and young adults. It also give some advices to parents who want to make mobile devices safer for their kids.The last chapter covers the case when you’ve been hacked. How to get your life back?",
        "“Your life” is not exaggerated because mobile devices contains so much personal information (contacts, emails, sms, pictures, videos, notes, …). This chapter gives tips like:- How to make a backup?- Whom to contact in case of suspicious activity?- How to wipe? (partial vs complete)Then the book ended with some annexes. The first one cover IBM NotesTraveler, a email push solution for mobile devices.",
        "Irrelevant in books like this one which must remain vendor independant (the fact that the authors are working for IBM is not a valid reason). The annexes C gives a checklist of tips to protect your mobile device and the annexe D proposes a template of “Mobile Acceptable User Policy“.What to conclude? This books contains lot of useful information but you’ve to select them by yourself. If you are only a user, some chapters are worth a read.",
        "If you are an IT-guy of looking for a MDM solution, others might be interesting too. I would say: check the table of contents and follow your points of interest!The books is available online here.Profile"

In this space, the club ended up being in the left and tiny tables had been in the right as one stepped in; two single-stall restrooms had been behind the club.",

        "” In conformity using this guideline, she noted:“Every evening, a brief, handsome, butch woman with toilet paper covered around her hand, possessed a task to allot us toilet paper. … This butch girl would stand at the front end regarding the line and then we each got two wraps of wc paper. ”The room that is second50 Eighth Avenue), into the previous restaurant area, ended up being available through the trunk of this primary club and offered table solution.",

Mardenborough recalled that whenever the authorities raided the club, which happened regular, a key will be pushed that fired up a red light in the “back space. ” Then, he stated, “Everything would freeze and folks would cost their tables and merely stay like they’re having drinks.",

Review by DBK- My husband and I both have extremely dry hands in the winter time, and this is the only product we have found that works without making our hands greasy and grimy feeling. It's light, fragrance-free, and makes your hands feel totally soft and moisturized. (Posted on 4/6/15)- The best hand lotion on the market!",
        "Review by Katzenjammerz- The Quince Hand Lotion is the only product that has ever cleared my stress eczema, and also helped my hands through a Minnesota winter! (Posted on 2/25/15)- Cannot live without it! Review by Beth- Hands down one of the best hand creams you could use in those cold months. It 's fast absorbing, not greasy and has a light scent.",
        "I love that I can use it while I am driving and throw my hands right back onto the wheel because it absorbs THAT FAST!(Posted on 11/3/14)- Great product Review by Sally- Fantastic product for dry SENSITIVE skin. Works great! (Posted on 7/2/13)- Better Than a Prescription Review by illbbax- 8 years ago, I took a position up north while I was living in Tampa, Florida.",
        "The skin on my hands would crack in the dry, cold winters of Dayton, Ohio.I was close to going to a dermatologist for help; then a friend of mine was doing some Christmas shopping and I went along. She went to an apothecary and I asked if there was something I could put on my hands as a man, that would not have an un-masculine scent.I was directed to the Quince Hand Lotion #007 and have used it religiously ever since. I am a believer in this product.",
        "Anyone who complains about the price, doesn't realize how long lasting the tube is, how well it works, and how much a comparable product would cost from a pharmaceutical company prescribed by a doctor or pharmacist.If you're working on those new rigs in the Dakotas, try it, you'll love it. (Posted on 3/31/13)- Only thing that work Review by Producer Bill- I have dry hands, and I spend tons of time working with them however most hand lotions leave a greasy feeling. This doesn't and it heals my hands.",
        "Forget wondering if it will work. I am telling you right now it does and is well worth the cost. (Posted on 2/16/13)- Fantastic. Review by HB- Hands-down, the absolute best hand-cream I've used...relieves chapping almost immediately for me. Please bring it back SOON!!!",
        "(Posted on 2/4/13)- best ever Review by deean- i just love this hand cream its not greasy at all and soaks right in my hands please bring it back (Posted on 1/22/13)- GREAT Review by butterfly6801- I love this for hands, but even more than that I love it for my elbows. It keeps my elbows so soft, I have been out of it for about a month and my elbows really miss it. I can't wait until it's back in stock!!!!!",
        "(Posted on 1/16/13)- Favorite lotion ever Review by Sam- This is absolutely my favorite hand lotion ever, for two key reasons. First, it's silky and moisturizes really well, but unlike other effective moisturizers, it's not heavy or greasy. Most hand lotions either feel super-slippery or make your hands feel dirty afterwards because they're so heavy. This hits the Goldilocks zone.Second, it has a fresh citrus-y smell that gives you a pick me up and then GOES AWAY.",
        "I'm not a huge scent person so don't like heavy, perfumed hand lotions that stay with you for ages. This is just enough to give a nice whiff of a refreshing scent while you're rubbing it in and then you can go back to your day.So really, it's perfect. I actually go on and on about this lotion so much that once I was in the NY store at the counter and a woman behind me picked it up to look at it, and I started telling her how great it was until she decided to buy it.",
        "Because I had basically just sold a bottle of lotion, the sales lady who was ringing me up slyly put extra samples in my bag. So great lotion AND great store! (Posted on 6/1/12)-)"

        "In 1971, NASA sent three astronauts who were University alumni to the moon as part of the Apollo 15 lunar mission.",
        "Now, three University professors have been chosen for a new NASA project, one that believes many answers may be blowing in the wind.On Monday, NASA announced that a team of Michigan University professors - Christopher Ruf, professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences and electrical engineering and computer sciences; Aaron Ridley, associate professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences; and Derek Posselt, assistant professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences - were chosen to receive $151.7 million over the next five years to undertake their Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System project.The project aims to simultaneously launch eight satellites by 2016 that will spend at least two years in space where they will gather data about cyclones and other tropical storms that previous technology found difficult to provide because of the difficulty of studying inside oceanic storms.The team of professors beat out 18 other teams that submitted proposals when the agency offered an opportunity for funds for small spaceflight investigations in Earth's system, made possible by the Earth Venture-class series of projects in NASA's Earth Science Division.The University professors will partner with Southwest Research Institute of Texas, Surrey Satellite Technology of Colorado and the NASA Ames Research Center to build the satellites and gather data that can be used for research.In Earth's orbit, the satellites' functions will include probing the interaction between seawater and air and how that interaction has a role in the development of hurricanes and other tropical storms.Ruf, the project's principal investigator, said the satellites will be up in space to monitor hurricanes for at least two hurricane seasons but noted that while the satellites are designed for a two-year lifetime, they may last longer.\"The first one is like a training session, to make sure everything is working and tune up all of the electronics properly, and then the second year we'll be able to really do it,\" Ruf said.Ruf said their mission was attractive to NASA because their satellites are smaller and less expensive than previous satellites.\"There's several different ways of looking at the surface conditions that have been flying since the 1970s, and the more traditional ways are much bigger and much more expensive,\" he said.Ruf added that the satellites' technology will allow for a mission that will be the first of its kind.\"As far as using this kind of technology specifically, it's been demonstrated twice before on satellites, but they were just these little demonstrations, things that only lasted for a few weeks to show that the idea was sound,\" Ruf said.",
        "\"But there was never like a full, concerted mission to do sustained science.\"Ruf said the team also extensively researched cyclones before submitting the proposal.\"We did a lot of historical analysis ...",
        "as part of the design study for how many satellites we would need and the detail about their design so we would be able to see a lot of hurricanes,\" Ruf said.The mission will focus on taking measurements of hurricanes during the hurricanes, which hasn't been done before, according to Ruf.\"(Old satellites) stopped working well as soon as you get close to the middle of the hurricane because there is too much rain, and this new technique can see right through the rain well, so that's a big-deal thing,\" Ruf said.Ruf added that studying such hard-to-reach areas of the storms can help meteorologists better forecast the intensity of hurricanes in the future.Posselt said he joined the project to further investigate convection as a general topic, rather than solely tropical cyclones.\"My task on this is ...",
        "to explore uses of this data to try to understand tropical precipitation,\" Posselt said.Posselt added that smaller storms are important to study as well.\"In the last five or 10 years or so, there's been a more concerted effort to try to understand these tropical systems, partly because they can give rise to hurricanes down the road if they persist long enough and organize in the right way,\" Posselt said.Posselt added that NASA saw how their proposal would benefit science without an exorbitant cost.\"So for NASA, I think this probably fell in a bit of a sweet spot ...",
        "it's a measurement that we don't have globally but it's using technology that we don't have to spend tens of millions of dollars developing,\" Posselt said.NASA spokesman Steve Cole said this mission will provide NASA with the kind of cutting-edge study of Earth they look for.\"NASA does a lot of research into developing for new ways to use the vantage point of space, having instruments in space to study weather, hurricanes, all sorts of earth science,\" Cole said.",
        "\"We've had a number of missions that study winds ... and this mission is kind of pushing the envelope.\"Cole added that it is somewhat unique for NASA to have a university-led mission.\"Most NASA missions are done not at universities, but we do have a history in a wide range of sciences of what we call P.I.-led missions. We have them in planet science and solar science,\" Cole said."

        "High Priest’s Garments - The Anointing and Significance of BlueContinuing with the series on High Priest, here is an excerpt from my sermon notes. (Skipping last week’s sermon on linen.) I did my best to summarize it, but this sermon is really oozing with revelations. Be blessed!First off, the robe of the ephod (Exo 28:31-35). Note that the opening for the head was reinforced so that it cannot be torn. The High Priest cannot tear clothes by the law.",
        "(Lev 21:10) However, Caiaphas, the High Priest at the time of Jesus’ crucifixion, tore his clothes. (Mat 26:65, Mar 14:63) He broke the law. Without knowing it, what he did signified the change of order of priesthood.Jesus is our High Priest, after the order of Melchizedek. The only difference between Jesus and the Israel High Priests is the order of priesthood. In Aaronic priesthood, the priests blessed only on the condition of obedience, and cursed if there was disobedience, in accordance with the law.",
        "(Lev 26:3-29) In Melchizedek priesthood, however, as seen in the book of Genesis, Melchizedek always blessed. He blessed Abraham (then Abram) and the Father, and gave Abraham bread and wine. In fact, the first word that came out of his mouth was “blessed”. (Gen 14:19) So Jesus, our High Priest in the order or Melchizedek, always speaks and does blessings.Remember that the law demands righteousness, while grace gives righteousness.",
        "Under grace, even when you fail, you still receive blessings, and this will make you want to do right.Next, we look at the anointing of the priesthood in Exodus 29:4-10. In verse 7, there was the anointing of Aaron as High Priest.",
        "Then, from verse 10, animals were brought and slaughtered; it was not until verse 21, after the animals were slaughtered, that Aaron’s sons were anointed.As Aaron was the High Priest and his sons were priests, today, as we are a royal priesthood with Jesus as our High Priest, Aaron’s sons was a type of us. This is a beautiful picture of what happened. Jesus Christ was anointed before He died.",
        "We were anointed after His death, which was signified by the animals’ sacrifice.One more thing about the High Priest’s anointing is the divine order found in this ordination. When the High Priest is anointed, oil flows from the High Priest’s head down his beard before it reaches his body. This is depicted in a psalm, Psalm 133:1-3.The order his head, beard, body (all the way to the edge).",
        "So this is God’s order: blessing goes from the head, which is the pastors, then to the elders, signified by the beard, then to the body, that is the entire church. Due to this order, when you pray for your pastors, you are, in fact, praying for yourself, because as the leader goes, so goes the church. Do not be jealous when the pastors get blessed; know that you are next in line! Hallelujah!Back to Exodus 28:31, the robe of the ephod is blue in colour.Now blue, as we learned, is the heavenly colour.",
        "It speaks of divinity. However, there is another, deeper meaning to blue. We look at the Hebrew word for blue: “tekheleth”. This word comes from another word in Hebrew: “kahlah”. Kahlah means perfection, completeness. At the Cross, perfection is displayed, as God’s holiness kissed God’s mercy, and God’s demand met God’s provision.There is one ordination that God made in Numbers 15:37-39. God commanded the Israelites to make the tassels, and you still see it in today’s Israel.",
        "In face, the Pharisees’ tassels were longer than usual, to show of their “spiritual” status.The tassels on the corners of garments had a blue thread to it. Why is this significant?In Luke 8:43-44, a woman with the issue of blood came to Jesus. She was poor (spent all her money on physicians) and sick, so she was doubly sorrowful. She touched the border, that is, the corner, of Jesus’ garment, and she was healed. Now, on the corners of Jesus’ garment were the tassels with a blue thread.",
        "The woman touched completion of a perfect work. Blue speaks of the finished work of Jesus, of completeness. Now, please don’t go out from church and buy blue clothes or wear the tassels; these things were outward for our study that you may know that because of Jesus’ finished work: you are complete in Him. Hallelujah!Good related information! I have been hunting for everything like that for quite a while currently.",
        "Regards!now at this time I’am doing my best to do a study on the garments, and espicially a study on the prayer shaw,old and new covenat. any more info. u may have would be great. thankyou for all ur answers here in this segment."

        "Just the beginning for ”Bubba”by Peter Schwartz On Thu, Jun. 15, 2017After his Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series debut, Darrell Wallace Jr. continues his journey in Michigan.The reality was that “Bubba” made his Monster Energy Cup Series debut driving the famous #43 and became just the 4th African-American driver to ever participate in the highest level of NASCAR.“I will cheer up,” said the 23 year old Wallace after the race. “This was a wonderful day for me, a wonderful day for the sport.",
        "I wish we could have got a little bit better finish in our Smithfield Ford, but I’m just thankful for the opportunity. I’ve been dreaming about this since I was a little kid and now it’s here, and I made a name for myself. We’ll build off of it. I’ll practice more with the dash and go debrief with the team, and we’ll just get better.”With those words, Wallace put it all into perspective and showed a great deal of maturity but also the passion to get better.",
        "He might have been down a bit after the race, but the magnitude of his accomplishment in getting to that moment in his career is what he will remember most about his historic day and not necessarily the speeding penalties that he attained during the course of the day.With all of those thoughts racing through his head, Wallace went through a whirlwind of emotions.",
        "After the race, he had a very productive conversation with RPM Co-Owner Andrew Murstein.“We spoke and he was upset with the speeding penalties and he was beating himself up a little bit,” said Murstein. “I loved to see that. It tells me how hungry he is. It reminded me a little of (the movie) “Talladega Nights” and the line “If you’re not first your last.” He wants nothing short of a win eventually. I told him that every long journey starts with a first step.",
        "Pocono was his first step in what should be a long and very successful career.”While he had mixed emotions about his performance at Pocono, Wallace certainly had a lot to smile about for a couple of reasons.",
        "1st of all, it was an historic day for him just to be in the race and his good friend Ryan Blaney notched his 1st career win driving the iconic #21 car for Woods Brother Racing.The two buddies had a nice chat before the race about how getting to this point and representing these two teams was pretty surreal.“I loved how you had two young men in Bubba and Ryan talking before the race about how cool it was that they were driving arguably the two most prestigious numbers in the sport.",
        "They have great respect for the tradition and history of NASCAR. “That’s great to see and unfortunately is rare amount many athletes in other sports.”Wallace will certainly remember that 1st day in a Monster Energy Cup Series race for a long time, but for the moment it’s time to turn the page and move on to the next race this Sunday in Michigan for the “FireKeepers Casino 400”. It’s a fast track that Wallace is very comfortable with.“I like that place,” said Wallace.",
        "“I think I run a little bit better at Michigan. I’m looking forward to it. (Pocono) is a first step. I know we ran a good, clean race, and that’s all you can ask, didn’t wreck the car, brought it home in one piece, so I’m pumped for the guys.”It’s always good to see a little from an athlete, regardless of what sport it is. While Wallace was beating himself up over his mistakes at Pocono, he’s using it as motivation to get better starting this week in Michigan.",
        "The great ones have that ability to turn adversity into prosperity. “Bubba” is still climbing the ladder but has already shown what type of competitor he is.“I like how hungry he is and he also seems to see the big picture,” said Murstein. “The great ones have that.

        "Having Bubba succeed in this sport will be a great thing for everyone.”Wallace earned this opportunity with RPM because of what he accomplished in the NASCAR XfINITY Series and Camping World Truck Series where he notched five career wins.",
        "With that 1st victory, the graduate of NASCAR’s “Drive for Diversity” program became the 1st African-American to win a NASCAR race since Hall of famer Wendell Scott.But now he has reached the highest level of the sport and the competition is second to none.“These guys are good,” said Wallace. “These guys are here for a reason. There’s no more climbing. I’ve been in the ladder rungs for the last couple years and now I’m at the top.",
        "There’s nothing else I can do but just to go out there and just get better and better and learn how this sport works and how this series works.”With RPM, Wallace is filling in for the injured Aric Almirola who is expected to return later this season after suffering a compression fracture of the T5 vertebra in a crash May 13th at Kansas Speedway.",
        "This is a golden opportunity for “Bubba” who has a chance to audition for another team or even earn a permanent role with RPM next season should they add a second car.It’s only been one race for RPM, but Wallace already has a big fan in the owner’s box.“If we are lucky enough to have support for two cars it would be very exciting to have Bubba drive our second car,” said Murstein. “I think he will be a big star in the sport one day, with or without us.",
        "I hope it’s with us.”Darrell Wallace Jr. has worked very hard to get to this point. He’s already made NASCAR history but that’s only one chapter of a book he hasn’t finished writing yet. The next chapter is this Sunday in Michigan and he’ll use the rest of his opportunity with RPM to set the tone for what lies ahead next year and in years to come.But it certainly looks and sounds like Wallace and Richard Petty Motorsports is a marriage made in NASCAR heaven."

        "When one considers all the national and global crises that dominated the 2015 headlines, 2016 has the potential to be one of those landmark years that could change history.In my lifetime, 1968 falls into that category. I vividly remember that at age 13, I tried to process the urban riots and the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy.",
        "An emerging “women’s liberation” movement caught my interest, as I was trying to understand a new distrust of government called the “credibility gap.” But overall, it was the Vietnam War that dominated the nightly news.",
        "This was because in 1968 alone, 16,592 Americans were killed, making it the war’s deadliest year.From my suburban-Boston teenage perspective, it appeared that our nation was not only at war in Southeast Asia but fighting against itself in cities and on college campuses.Now, almost 48 years later, all the social, cultural, racial, global, and political upheavals that made 1968 the “year that changed everything” appear to be present again — only now on steroids — potent enough to make that tumultuous year look downright peaceful.In 2015, everyone, almost simultaneously, became increasingly fed-up, ticked-off, offended, or outraged.The reality of 2015 is that everyone, almost simultaneously, became increasingly fed-up, ticked-off, offended, or outraged about some personal, religious, ethnic, gender, economic, legal, global, environmental, political, media, hi-tech, sports, social, or GMO-food issue.Atop all that is an intense national distrust in the federal government and an increasing disdain for its growth, cost, waste, and incompetence.",
        "Moreover, given that Americans are so polarized, the government always stands accused of doing either too much or too little — screwing up, whatever your major gripe or cause happens to be, viewed from the perspective of your political leanings.In response to all this mayhem, we the people have opened our virtual windows and are yelling, “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take this anymore” — a flashback from the iconic 1976 movie Network — but with a new twist.",
        "Social media have become our new “window,” making it possible for us to rant and rave and show and tell everything to anyone, anywhere, at all times.Since 2008, when then-senator Barack Obama campaigned on the slogan “Hope and Change” — and went on win the White House on a wave of feel-good bromides — we’ve witnessed a precipitous decline in national optimism and a rise in fear.In 2016, if there is a contest for an official national slogan, my entry will be “Fear and Change.” Fear is reflected in a recent Quinnipiac poll that showed 83 percent of American voters believing that it is “very likely” or “somewhat likely” that a major terrorist attack will strike the U.S.",
        "in the near future.Fear was also the driving force in a December 14 NBC/WSJ poll that prompted 40 percent of Americans to name “national security and terrorism” as the issue that they believe should be the federal government’s top priority. This knocked “job creation and economic growth” from the number-one spot, down to number two, at 23 percent.",
        "This was a huge shift from April, when jobs and growth were cited by 29 percent as the issue that Americans believed should be the government’s top priority.Furthermore, this same NBC/WSJ poll found that only 20 percent of adults believe that our nation is headed in the right direction — compared with 70 percent who say it’s on the wrong track.There is no doubt that negativity and fear have permeated our national psyche.",
        "Fear is fueled by the perception that our government is failing to keep us safe from terrorism and mass shootings. There is also the fear that we have lost our postwar global influence — with grave consequences yet to be realized. Perhaps the greatest long-term fear is the realization that America is rapidly changing for the worse.",
        "This is coupled with voters’ widely shared belief that they are powerless to prevent these negative changes.Perhaps the greatest long-term fear is the realization that America is rapidly changing for the worse.All of the above is the backdrop for what is guaranteed to be a traumatic 2016 at home and abroad, while a contentious presidential election takes center stage.These fear-driven attitudes explain why businessman Donald Trump — whose slogan is “Make America Great Again” — is currently leading in the race for the Republican nomination.",
        "Most of his supporters strongly believe that he is America’s last great hope.With a controversial candidate such as Trump, and an unpopular candidate like Hillary Clinton, the kind of social and political discontent that sparked the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention could return with new force in 2016, erupting at one or both of the summer’s national nominating conventions.A major difference between 1968 and today, however, is that draft-age youth of that era were passionate, demanding an end to the Vietnam War.",
        "In 2016, fear of national decline and terrorism will be central issues, but they are not — yet — stirring up anywhere near as much passion.",
        "There is a distinct possibility, though, that the volatile issues of economic inequality, the growth of a large permanent underclass, and a demand for social justice and for criminal-justice reform among minority groups could explode at any time, creating massive national chaos.In 2016, this we know for sure: No matter who is elected president, half the electorate will be convinced that our once-great nation is forever doomed.But the risk of doom will be reduced if Hillary Clinton wins, because recently out on the campaign trail she said, “We’ve got to do everything we can to weed out hate and plant love and kindness.” Then, in a separate speech to African-American ministers, Clinton announced that she is running on a “love and kindness platform.”This platform, along with her new campaign slogan “Love Trumps Hate,” channels that popular 1968 saying “Make Love, Not War.” Could this be Clinton’s secret strategy to defeat ISIS?Our nation survived 1968, but 2016 is shaping up to be even more traumatic.— Myra Adams is a media producer and political writer.",

People purchase for self-serving reasons. They don’t buy because they should, because it’s right, or because they need it.",

        "We'd Like To Thank You, Herbert Hoover, For Really Showin' Us the Way The Time Treadmill Ron Miles 10th DoctorMartha Jones Apr 16 2018 I am virtually certain there is no other episode of NuWho that I have pre-complained about more than Daleks in Manhattan. That is not to say that it is my least favorite modern story (that's a toss-up between Kill the Moon or Sleep No More), but it's the one that not only features the Daleks but exemplifies my frustration with them. How can I miss you if you won't go away?",
        "So let's talk about that. Daleks in Manhattan (TARDIS Data Core recap) This story, set in Depression-era New York City, features a wide array of American accents ranging from passable to truly awful. It also features a guest turn by Andrew Garfield a full half-decade before he would become Spider-Man. He's not very memorable in the role. Finally, it features four Daleks - none of whom ever shout, \"EXTERMINATE!\" It's like, what's the point of being a Dalek if you aren't going to do any exterminating?",
        "These four are the Cult of Skaro, who did an emergency time shift to escape the Battle of Canary Wharf during the previous season's finale, and they are behind a lengthy plot that involves turning humans into pig-faced slaves (I have no idea why Russel T Davies is so fascinated by the idea of pig monsters, maybe he once had a bad truffle-hunting vacation to France).",
        "Their plot also involves affixing some Dalekanium plates to the top mast of the under-construction Empire State Building so that they can do a whole Frankenstein thing and create a Dalek-Human hybrid. Because, of course. It's just... not good. When the first Dalek showed up in Dalek it was a chilling episode that was masterfully written. When they came back for the first season finale it was a shocking moment.",
        "When they came back again for the second season finale it was somewhat less shocking, but generally well done. By the time Hooverville of the Daleks rolls around it marks the sixth and seventh episodes with them in two-and-a-half years. Seriously, enough already. Even the Doctor is bored with them, he can barely work up a visceral \"oh nos they are going to destroy humanity\" moment. I dunno, maybe the bad American stereotypes play better in the U.K.",
        "God knows they must think our British and Scottish stereotypes are wretched. Honestly, though, I just could not care less about the doomed love story between showgirl Tallulah and PigMan Laszlo. And the fact that the cast list includes an actual credit for \"Hero Pig\" just sums it all up. Blech. Tomorrow I will slog through the back half of the story, Wednesday I will slog through The Lazarus Experiment, and then Thursday I can get back to enjoying this project.",

        "and Traffic Cast.“By visiting a variety of cities, we had the opportunity to view the phenomenal growth of monster coastal cities, such as Shanghai, and the continuation of traditional methods of farming and life in more rural areas, such as Ninghai,” said Marianne Johnson, UW Oshkosh associate economics professor.“We also had an opportunity to see Beijing’s preparation for the Olympics in August, including their famous Bird’s Nest Stadium, to be used for opening ceremonies, and the Water Cube,” she said.Higher educationThe faculty visited two universities in Shanghai: the China-Europe International Business School (CEIBS) and Shanghai University.",
        "CEIBS is a private university that offers only graduate study in business, with an MBA and executive MBA (EMBA), as well as certificate programs.",
        "Both are ranked in the top 10 internationally for their business programs and have a number of impressive facilities, including a finance center that provides top-level consulting, research and workshops for the Chinese government and Chinese businesses.CEIBS is seeking accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), a move that will place more limits on its structure and actions but which, the administration feels, is necessary to recruit faculty and students internationally.",
        "UW Oshkosh is the only AACSB-accredited university in northeastern Wisconsin.The University of Shanghai, a public university that primarily serves local students, offers semester-long and summer study programs taught in English for business students.One of the major problems facing the Chinese education system is that there are more Chinese students seeking admission to universities than there are spots available.",
        "Just prior to the faculty’s arrival, Hangzhou Foreign Language School (HFLS), an elite public high school, held its college entrance exam. The exams determine whether a student can seek admittance to a university as well as what level of university.UW Oshkosh’s College of Business hopes to pursue a cooperative agreement with HFLS to guarantee admittance of five students per year to UW Oshkosh’s business program.Business and industryThe faculty visited a number of different types of businesses.",

        "companies as well as shifting production to more sophisticated and specialized parts for green technologies.Another characteristic of the companies’ officers was a concern over rising input prices, including higher labor costs due to a new Chinese labor law requiring companies to provide a range of insurances for workers, higher commodity prices and higher energy prices.“We also learned that there are significant differences in government and tax treatment of Chinese-owned, joint-venture and wholly foreign-owned companies,” Johnson said.",
        "“For those thinking of producing in China, negotiating government bureaucracy, labor laws, environmental laws and so forth can be very difficult, and there are advantages and disadvantages of each type of ownership structure that bear careful investigation.”In addition to factories, the faculty toured several service-provision organizations, including Wisconsin law firm Godfrey & Kahn, Nielson Market Research and Traffic Cast.",
        "Representatives of all three companies emphasized several shared themes: the rise of the Chinese middle class and of discretionary consumption and the vast differences in regional preferences and customs.Nielson reported on the success of Pizza Hut and how the company addressed cultural differences between American and Chinese diners, such as the difficulty of selling salad to Chinese consumers.",
        "Traffic Cast provided evidence of the rising demand for consumer service products, including real-time traffic reports and forecasts.GovernmentThe visiting faculty also met with governmental and international organizations, including a Wisconsin Department of Commerce representative, an officer of the U.S. Commercial Services Office and the American Chamber of Commerce president in Beijing.“While all were largely positive about U.S.",

        "WINDOW TRENDS FOR 2019Windows continue to grow in size while frames recede in response to consumer demand.Brought to you by JELD-WENCourtesy of Jeld-Wen |The forecast for windows in the coming year and beyond is big units with an unobstructed viewing field, set in minimal frames of a dark hue.The aesthetic is unabashedly modern, and shapes are square and rectilinear.“I actually think the move towards modern—I use the term to mean clean and unfussy—is here to stay,” says Greenwich, Conn.-based designer and builder Sabine Schoenberg, host of Sabine’s New House.To achieve the large window units that home buyers want, architects are mulling windows together, sometimes mixing shapes.",
        "Corner windows are a trend, says JELD-WEN’s Jennifer Matson. “For larger windows, like in living areas, fixed windows are just fine. We can make an inoperable window larger than one that operates. It just comes down to the weight of the glass.”“Everybody wants more glass and less frame,” says Joe LeFlore, South Florida Millwork vice president. “Bigger is better.",
        "I got five plans today and every one is floor-to-ceiling windows.” LeFlore notes that a lot of manufacturers are doing away with grids and muntins to increase the windows’ viewing area.“And screens are going away.” While screens are always an option, he says that many people just don’t want them, and don’t want the hassle of storing something they won’t use.The trend toward black frames on both the interior and exterior of windows continues to charm, while painted metallic frames are surging.",
        "Painted versus an actual metal frame is the preference because while home buyers may like the look, committing to a frame they may tire of in a few years is a concern. Especially since aluminum windows are costly to thermal break, says Matson, JELD-WEN’S director of product line management for wood windows.Black seems here to stay, but the palette for other darker colors is expanding.",
        "“I’ve seen the darker colored frames like dark brown and barn red and dark greens, and wood is really the substrate for that,” says Matson. “We have refreshed that interior sash palette with gray—and it may shift to a warmer brown-gray—and some stains.",
        "We also do custom colors.”Even in production building, where keeping costs in line is often at odds with trends, Philadelphia architect Jim Wentling will use smaller square windows as accents, usually in a Craftsman-style home, or a ribbon window in a ranch-style home.Florida architect Tony Weremeichik likes to use floor-to-ceiling glass.",
        "“That’s tough for production builders, but they can swap them out for double-hung units and gang them.” To meet buyers’ expectations, Weremeichik suggests builders try to get as much glass in their homes as possible within their means and budget.For assistance with your 2019 projects, including incorporating window trends such as these, visit JELD-WEN’s professional portal."

        "I'm on the phone with Liza Minnelli, and all that involves. She's telling me she'll be singing mostly her signature tunes in her Seattle show, but that she'll also throw in a few surprises.To even get to this point, I've had to promise her people not to discuss alcohol, rehab, or The Ex-Husband That Dare Not Speak His Name. I've also had to allow her manager, Danny, to listen in on the conversation from his mobile phone to ensure that I'll adhere to those promises.",
        "I'm not thrilled with the ground rules, though I agree to them. Come on—it's Liza Minnelli.",
        "I'm not gay enough to have all her albums, but I am certainly gay enough to want to start an article with \"I'm on the phone with Liza Minnelli.\"She sounds exactly like you think she does—warm, weird, gushing, grand, punctuating her sentences with random bursts of happy laughter and responding to every question with an emphatic sincerity that is in some strange way both less real and more fabulously genuine than the way you or I talk.",
        "Danny, meanwhile, has sworn to be \"a fly on the wall\" during the interview. Quickly, it becomes obvious that the fly he's referring to is Jeff Goldblum in the Cronenberg film.",
        "Danny carefully hovers for the length of the brief, cheerfully uneventful conversation, either in fear for his life, in fear for hers, or maybe, some complex combination of the two:Seattle Weekly: So, is this a mini-tour?Liza Minnelli: Yeah, we're playing—how many dates, Danny?Danny: There's a total of seven dates right now.Minnelli: I haven't been out West for a while, and I wanted to come back and do that.Danny: Yes, exactly.Minnelli: Yes!To be honest, I'm surprised to hear Liza is even coming.",
        "Everybody knows she's been through a lot of late; hell, \"been through a lot\" has been her lot throughout four decades of giving her all. Performers are a dime a dozen now, but what they do doesn't involve the same kind of sweat it did back when Liza was learning her game, when people made their whole lives about entertaining, whole lives that seemed outrageously larger than the ones the rest of us were living—a bit of engaging fantasy that reality TV has pummeled into oblivion.",
        "You're supposed to be jaded and ironic now when you talk about such people. But ladies like Liza have all my respect for what must be exhausting self-awareness.I wonder out loud if she ever feels like, Hell, I've had it—I don't want to do this anymore.She sounds honestly horrified.\"No!\" she gasps, also a bit amused at the absurdity of such an idea. \"No, I've never felt that in my life! The music is such fun, and the acting within the music—and the rapport with an audience. It's . . . an art, sort of.",
        "I don't mean to sound stuck-up, but it's a craft I learned when I was 14, 15, 16, and . . . how can I explain it? It's just what I do.\" She roars with laughter.Danny interjects. \"It's what you do, and it's what you do fabulously!\"\"Thank you,\" Liza responds demurely.Anyway.",
        "It must be odd, I say, to be renowned as a live entertainer in an age when people can get their 15 minutes of fame on Survivor.\"Well, if that's true, I've had the longest 15 minutes in the world, I'll tell ya!\" she hoots.But doesn't she worry about keeping up with the all changes in the industry?\"I don't, really, no,\" she says. \"But, you know, when you think about it, I'm a performing artist who's never had a hit record. There aren't any others. People have a hit record, then they go out and perform.",
        "I'm an entertainer.\"What has she noticed that's different now about entertainment?\"I think it's braver now,\" she says. \"I think you can do things and say things onstage, and sing songs about things, that you couldn't [before]. But, you know, I've always just done it the way I've always done it, which is, I find the song, I find the character. I write a little background for her: What kind of clothes does she wear? What is her kitchen like? Does she have decals on the fridge?",
        "And it's very detailed so that I totally inhabit the character.\"Is there anything she'd like to do that she hasn't done yet?\"Take a nap!\" she howls.\"Isn't that the truth?!\" agrees Danny. \"Take a long nap! We all want to take a nap!\"She rather charmingly admits that she's spent her entire career wondering if she was ever going to get hired again.\"Really?\" I say. \"What did you think after winning the Oscar for Cabaret?\"\"I thought, 'This is never gonna happen again,'\" she swears, the laughter returning.",
        "\"But you have humor about it.",
        "You have to.\"Speaking of which, it has to be weird constantly seeing herself impersonated in pop culture—there's even someone playing her right now on Broadway in the campy Hugh Jackman musical The Boy From Oz.\"I haven't seen any of it,\" she insists.She hasn't?!\"No!\"Well, what does she think about it?A brief pause.\"I think I should be getting paid!\" she hollers, roaring again.\"Good for you!\" cries Danny.Then they're both off the phone and Liza, I presume, heads back out into the world to do what she does—fabulously.swiecking@seattleweekly.comLiza Minnelli plays Pier 62/63 at 7 p.m.",

        "BusinessWeek Investor -- Inside Wall StreetWhy Pioneer Could Get AmbushedTake a battered stock, figure in some industry consolidation and a 63-year-old CEO with no heir apparent, and it adds up to a company that is a potential takeover target.That's how things appear at Pioneer-Standard Electronics (PIOS), an electronics distributor, says Edward Shadek of Putnam Investments, the second-largest institutional investor with a near $19 million stake as of Sept. 30.",
        "The Cleveland electronics company stocks about 400,000 items--computers, circuits, and semiconductors--which it ships to resellers, manufacturers, and corporations worldwide. IBM, Compaq, and Intel alone account for about 60% of sales.Two Big Board-listed Pioneer rivals--$2.7 billion Arrow Electronics and $1.9 billion Avnet--have a lock on about 50% of the market. That makes third-ranked Pioneer, with its $300 million market cap, a likely buyout candidate, according to Shadek.",
        "\"I don't think it's a stretch to think you'd get 20 [a share],\" he says. Pioneer currently trades at 11 5/8, down from its 52-week high of 18 3/4 on Mar. 1. While the cyclical in tech is a concern, says Shadek, there are more pluses for Pioneer than minuses: First Call's consensus earnings forecast of $1.46 per share for the fiscal year ending Mar. 1, 2001, for a stock that trades at seven times earnings, \"doesn't have a lot of downside,\" says Shadek.",
        "\"A lot of the bad news is built in.\" Robert Damron of Tucker Anthony agrees that the stock has at least 100% upside in 12 to 18 months.Der Hovanesian Covers the Markets.; Gene Marcial Is on Vacation.; By Mara Der HovanesianReturn to topReturn to top"

        "On Saturday, November 14, it appears that president-elect Joe Biden and first lady-in-waiting Dr. Jill Biden spent their day like many of us did—on a bike ride.The pair—along with four members of their secret service detail, riding Cannondale hardtails—cruised around the paved trails of Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware, before a meeting with Biden’s transition team.",
        "Members of the media and photographers took videos and photos of the group—in this video, you can hear Yahoo News reporter Brittany Shepherd asking, “Are you any closer to making a cabinet decision?” to which Biden responds, “Yes.”Sign up for Bicycling All Access, and we’ll let you know every time Biden is spotted on a bikeBiden appeared to be riding a Trek FX hybrid, and a well-loved one from the looks of it.",
        "From what we could see in the photos, it had a Bontrager cockpit, linear pull rim brakes, and a rusty chain well past its prime. He came prepared for the ride with a headlight, and all of the bike’s reflectors are still intact (he’s the president-elect, he can do what he wants)..We can’t tell exactly what bike Jill is riding, but it looks to be similar to Biden’s—something functional and affordable.",
        "Affixed to her handlebar is an Axiom Seymour Handlebar Bag created with fabric made out of recycled fishing nets, as well as a small headlight. While Biden’s bike has a rigid fork, Jill’s is equipped with an RST suspension fork, leading us to believe she likes to get a little more sendy than the president-elect.Jill is wearing a Liv Rev Comp MIPS helmet and a jacket with the logo of Pelotonia, a charity ride in Ohio that raises money for cancer research, at which Biden gave a send-off speech in 2017.",
        "And everyone riding in this group is wearing a mask, which is important, given the rising cases of COVID-19 around the country.The last time the media was shouting to Biden on a bike was in August, when he was riding the same Trek in Delaware. Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked the then-candidate if he’d chosen a running partner yet.",
        "Biden said he had, and when Doocy asked who, he jokingly responded “You!” (spoiler alert: it was not him).We’re stoked that our president-to-be and future first lady are into cycling, and will be on high alert for any more #RidinWithBiden in the news."

        "Yesterday, a few co-workers and myself, were saying goodbyes to another who was leaving the firm to pursue a degree in political science and work for a campaign. The topic of demographics and statistics came up and it got me thinking. How often do public libraries use public demographics/statistics and/or ask for statistics from political parties? Could this data prove useful? Politicians use this data to determine where to campaign and where a certain percentage of voters typically live.",
        "Depending on the county, city, district, area, etc., library funds are often voted on by the people and/or decided by a governing board; knowing as much as possible about the people in the community has unknown value. A basic identity can be uncovered and some collections can then be geared towards that. However, the library would have to market the changes appropriately.",
        "Just as a politician goes door to door, sends out mailers, and has voices in neighborhoods speaking on their behalf- so too should the library.I understand that many libraries use this type of data but to what extent? Most certainly do not go as deep as politicians. Politicians employ specialist in organizing this data and lining it up with a campaign plan. Librarians though are armed with a skill set that would make tackling such an endeavor simple. A phone call to a local official would be a good start.",
        "The library wants to reach out to the people and an elected official would want the same. Perhaps the library could set up an appointment with the official’s campaign manager or a specialists from their campaign. It’s a win-win situation and most importantly a win for the public."

        "Peering through the misty windows on the top deck of the bus from Shanklin to Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, trying to make out the sea between the wind-swept trees and the pretty thatched cottages on a cold damp May day.This is how Mark Baker (53) recalls the moment when he first began to seriously think about investing in a holiday let.“We’d had a terrible holiday weather-wise earlier on in the year and we were running out of indoor activities to do with the kids and that’s when we decided to catch the bus and do a tour of the Island,“ says Mark, an IT manager from Chobham in Surrey.",
        "“My mind had begun to wander about retirement as I was looking at the houses – I know it’s still a few years off but I do need to start planning for the future. I can’t see myself living on the Island permanently when I retire but yet I am pulled to this beautiful place.“That’s when I thought about holiday homes and Brexit – my feeling is that more people may start holidaying in this country especially if the pound does become weaker against the Euro.",
        "To me a buy-to-let holiday investment makes sense and also I can see us coming over here more often as a family.”Investors such as Mark are becoming increasingly attracted to the holiday buy-to-let market not only because of Brexit but also possibly because of new tax rules, lending criteria and the success of service accommodation and Airbnb, believes Lee from OnPoint Mortgages.“We have found that there has certainly been more of an interest in the buy-to-let holiday market recently.",
        "This may also be because of the Pridential Regulation Authority enforcing stricter lending requirements on buy-to-let loans, and also new taxes on rental revenue.”With a holiday-let you can still offset your full mortgage interest repayments against tax.“Under HM Revenue & Customs rules, the property must be available for letting for at least 210 days in the year and be let for at least 105 days.",
        "But unlike conventional buy-to-lets, you can also use your holiday home for as much as 20 weeks a year.“There are other benefits too such as deducting the cost of doing up a property from your pre-tax profits and you don’t have to pay council tax on the property. With a buy-to-let holiday home you can also avoid local business rates.”Lee says that most buy-to-let lenders do not consider holiday lets because the property will not be let on an assured shorthold tenancy of between six and 12 months.",
        "OnPoint mortgages does, however, offer buy-let-mortgage products through lenders like Principality Building Society and Leeds Building Society.“Before considering a holiday home, it’s important to to take into account factors such as the type of market you are aiming at and how practical it is physically getting to the property.",
        "If you are going to be doing the maintenance yourself consider whether you would be happy to drive for several hours to get to your property, spend all the weekend doing the decorating and then drive all the way back home, ready for work the next day.“If you don’t want to maintain the property yourself, you may want to find a local maintenance company to look after the it and also a cleaner who could come in on change-over days.“You will need to think about how you are going to market your property, such as through your own website or use a holiday lettings specialist.”Lee also advises to look for areas which are being invested in, such as the development of new flats and shops.For would-be investor Mark, he is now considering different properties on the south Island as possible holiday-lets.“We’re having fun looking at properties and I can’t wait to have more holidays here!”OnPoint Mortgages offers a range of mortgages including for those looking to enter the buy-to-let holiday market.PrincipalityLeeds Building Society."

        "Retail-isation of Barclays continuesNews on Tuesday that Barclays had acquired the deposits, mortgages and business assets of consumer bank ING Direct UK, subject to regulatory approval, is consistent with the marked attempt to rebalance the group away from investment banking since retail banker Antony Jenkins took over as CEO.IFR Editor-at-large Keith MullinThrough the acquisition, the bank picked up £10.9bn (around US$17.5bn) of deposits at par along with a £5.6bn mortgage book at a 3% discount.With customer deposits of £113.9bn (US$182bn) as of June 30, the acquisition certainly isn’t a game-changer for Barclays in a numbers sense.But it comes a little more than a week after Jenkins stacked the group executive committee away from investment banking by splitting his old retail job into two and appointing both incumbents (Valerie Soranno Keating, CEO of Barclaycard; and Ashok Vaswani, former CEO of UK Retail and Business Banking now responsible for retail and business products and services) to the group ExCom.That’s certainly a radical transformation from Bob Diamond’s ExCom, which had himself, Rich Ricci and Jerry del Missier from the investment bank in the inner circle.",
        "To my way of thinking, that was about right since the CIB division made and continues to make the majority of group profits.Since taking over, Jenkins had made broadly positive noises about the importance of the investment bank.",
        "But when he appointed Soranno Keating and Vaswani, he said the changes “reflect the importance of our retail businesses for Barclays and will make for a better balance between business and functional representation on the Executive Committee”.Streamlining is one of those ominous words that are invariably used as a codeword for cuttingI don’t know about better balance: of the four global business-line heads on the 10-strong committee; two hail from the retail and business banking side (sharing 41.5% of revenues and 38% of pre-tax profits between them using interim 1H12 numbers); Tom Kalaris, CEO of Wealth & Investment Management, has less than 6% of revenues and 2.7% of profits, while Ricci is now the only representative of the corporate and investment bank, which generates close to 53% of revenues and 59% of profits.That’s not better balance; that’s unbalanced and it certainly bodes ill for the investment bank in terms of Ricci’s room for manoeuvre and ability to influence outcomes.Streamlining (read: cutting?)At the same time, Ricci has been tasked with streamlining the corporate and investment bank.",
        "Streamlining is one of those ominous words that are invariably used as a codeword for cutting. Jenkins has already said he would exit activities that cause reputational risk. It’s not clear specifically what he means by that – outside areas such as tax advisory, which has been widely criticised as facilitating large-scale tax avoidance. But cuts to the CIB are widely expected.As for Ricci’s shake-up of the CIB at the end of last week, it all seemed sensible enough.",
        "The big winners were Frenchman Eric Bommensath, head of the newly combined FICC and equities global markets businesses; and Tom King, most recently head of EMEA investment banking and co-head of global corporate finance and M&A.Bommensath has taken over the global equities mantle formerly held by Jerry Donini as well as responsibility for global distribution, a role formerly held by Guglielmo Sartori di Borgoricco who is leaving the bank. How Bommensath structures the team beneath him will be key.",
        "A fixed-income man through and through – and a derivatives specialist at that – he’ll need to put some decent firepower in place to make sure equities doesn’t get crushed under the weight of the FICC platform.That firepower won’t be in the form of Donini, though, since the former head of equities shifted to become COO of the CIB in a move that kind of looks like one of those face-saving moves to avoid him having to report to Bommensath.Investment banks have never been quite sure about regional heads in a globalised industry with tribal product alliances and alignmentsKing has been singled out for greatness.",
        "A 20-year Citigroup man and M&A rainmaker, he only joined Barclays in October 2009 but he was promoted into the waiting room of deputy head of IB before he takes over from Skip McGee in 2013 when McGee’s day-job shifts to running CIB in the Americas away from his current slot as global head of investment banking.",
        "McGee, the former Lehman man, will keep his hat in the IB ring, though, by taking over as chairman.I wonder whether King will continue the streamlining of the investment banking group that McGee had kicked off in April when the corporate finance and M&A groups were merged under the trio of Tom King and Ros Stephenson (formerly co-heads of corporate finance) and Paul Parker, global head of M&A.The merger made sense, as M&A execution was previously managed separately from corporate finance, which housed the industry sector and coverage teams.Ricci has gone for a matrix of regional CEOs working alongside – or is that against?",
        "– global product heads. Investment banks have never been quite sure about regional heads in a globalised industry with tribal product alliances and alignments. (I also wonder about the sense of shifting McGee, a classic Wall Street investment banker, into an operational management role).The rise of three regional CEOs will certainly engage more of Larry Wieseneck’s time.",
        "In another April change, Wieseneck had moved out of his former role as head of Global Finance & Risk Solutions (ECM, DCM, leveraged finance and loans) to become head of strategy for the CIB in a role designed to ensure better alignment between businesses and regions.With only four of the 13 people sitting on Ricci’s CIB executive committee sporting functional business-line responsibilities versus three with regional responsibilities, it’ll be an interesting balance.",
        "And to that point, having Larry Kantor sitting on the CIB ExCom as head of research with a direct line into Ricci is an anomaly relative to how other investment banks are structured.Most research heads fall under the global markets function. I wonder if that’s the way Barclays will go as it continues to move forward. If so, that’ll make the region/product split 3-3. Could be a classic divide-and-rule construct.Have your sayTo have your say, you have to be signed in"

        "I have never been one for decorating my house, much to the chagrin of my mother who changes everything down to her curtains just about every season. When she moved back to Idaho several years ago, she stayed with my brother for a month and drove him nuts with all her ideas of what he needed/should do to decorate his house. He still bitches about that. When James died and she saw my house for the first time, she offered some suggestions as to what I should do with it which I just ignored.",
        "For me, it is not so much the decor that matters but the feel. And my house feels like a home. Even with James gone, you can still feel the love when you walk in the door. (Once you get past the excitement of the boys, who you would think have never seen people before, that is).But as part of the grief recovery process, I do feel it wouldn't hurt to add a few feminine touches here and there as part of that whole making the house \"mine\" instead of \"ours\" thing.",
        "My friend offered to help me with that, which I wisely did not tell my mother when she told me about this season's curtain scheme (blue, I think. I wasn't really listening). I would have gotten another lecture on how I need to get some pretty curtains. My mom is very big on her curtains. I don't want curtains-I have really cool wood blinds. Well, they look like wood anyway.",
        "My friend and I have looked at a couple of stores and I have pointed out a few things I like so she is keeping that in the back of her mind when she is out and about. She changes her house around from time to time and it always looks nice so I trust her. And yes, she does have curtains. But just on one window. She has blinds on the rest.Today on my way home, I stopped to get a birthday present for a friend and ended up getting a few things for myself.",
        "I really shouldn't have spent the money, but I justified it by everything I bought for myself being 20% off.The first thing I got was a 12\" x 12\" square wall hanging with a seashell in the middle that says \"It's not what you look at that matters,\" down most of the left side and \"it's what you see.\" across most of the bottom. The shell looks like it is sitting on a antique yellow fabric square and the background behind it is different blues and browns.",
        "I am going to put this in my master bathroom, which is light blue with a darker marble looking blue counter. I have always thought some sort of nautical theme would work in there.",
        "My real reason for putting this in there, however, is so I will see it when I am getting ready in the morning and remind myself to really look at the person I am-not just the package I come in.The second thing I got is a small plaque (about 9\" x 4\") that has a small blue butterfly in the lower left corner and a weird purple and blue flower with a green stem and leaves on the right side that says \"Life is a journey not a Destination\" on the left above the butterfly.",
        "I am not yet sure where this is going to go; I am thinking maybe by James' picture and his urn for now. It is a reminder to take the time to enjoy life now and not worry so much about getting to my future.The last plaque I got is also small-about 5\" x 7\"- and has a daisy at the top and one of my new found favorite quotes in the middle: \"Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain.\" It says Dance across the bottom.",
        "As any fan of Grey's Anatomy can tell you, sometimes you just have to dance it out. I am thinking about finding a spot here in the office for this one. This is my reminder to learn to find and appreciate the good in life even when it all seems to be going downhill.There was one other plaque I was really tempted to get. It says \"I am not a fast cook and I am not a slow cook. I am a half-fast cook.\" I'm actually a pretty decent cook; I just thought that was really funny, especially when you say it out loud.",
        "The sale goes for another couple of days. I may have to go back for that.With what little I have done so far, I have come to realize that no matter what I put on the walls or how many rooms I paint, James' essence will still be here and I am more than fine with that. It's what makes my house my home. But making my home a little more girly (I am SO not a girly girl) won't hurt anything and could actually be fun. But don't tell Mom I said that.1 comment:Oh Heather, I LOVE to decorate!!! It is my Calling!!",
        "I wish so much we lived closer. We would have so much fun together. I would drag your but out of the house and to the local Michaels and show you a real craft store. Beautiful stuff. I make my own wreaths and decorations. A lot less now that I have two small children, but I try to do what I can.",
        "I enjoy decorating for Holidays, but this year will SUCK big time since it will be the first one without my sister.:( I don't know how I am going to get through Christmas without her, it was our favorite time of year. Once you start decorating the place to suit you, you will enjoy it more and more. You are so used to taking into consideration that you had a man around and not to make it too \"girly\", I think you lost track of the fun in it. You can decorate with out being girly.",

        "In the previous post I cited a tool for Photoshop I’m working on – which is currently on its beta cycle, thanks to the people of Colortheory.",
        "Basically, it’s a Photoshop script that lets you control separately both Amount and Radius for Unsharp Mask filter’s Dark and Light halos: that is, you can apply USM 500% and 1.5px for Dark Halos and 300%, 0.9px for Light ones, tweaking sliders on a single GUI.Being it a Script and not a Filter means that I have to drive Photoshop behind the scenes while you play with the interface (I don’t have pixel access, it would require a programming knowledge exceeding my skills).",
        "In other words I must find a way to replicate with layers and filters that very effect; not only, the scheme update must be easy, because I can’t afford the whole processing to be time consuming (otherwise the live-update performance of the tool would degrade).That is to say: I won’t follow the steps outlined in the post #1 of the series – producing two halo maps via Calculations, which would require a new calculation each time the user changes a single value.",
        "I need on-the-fly updatable parameters – I’m afraid I need Smart Objects (SO). I’m not particularly fond of SO – yet they provide Smart Filters (SF) which fit perfectly my requirements: SF are Filters applied non-permanently to a SO, i.e. you can decide to change their parameters anytime, or switch them on/off.Given this framework, how would you deal with SO and SF to split USM dark and light halos?",
        "There are at least two easy and intuitive ways that may came to your Photoshop-driven mind (they came to mine, too) – yet they’re wrong; this post is just about this – how not to be fooled by appealing, easy paths.Blending modes: Darken / LightenLet me use this exciting picture as an example:Reminder: to convert a layer in a Smart Object, right click on the layer’s name in the Layers palette and choose Convert to Smart Object.",
        "Be aware that if you right click on the layer’s icon the option does not show (there must be good reasons that I miss for that).",
        "Alternatively, via menu: Layer – Smart Objects – Convert to Smart Object.That said, if you duplicate the Background layer, convert it to SO, apply the Unsharp Mask Filter (USM, say 500% 10px, we’ll always leave Threshold untouched) and set the SO blending mode to Lighten, this is what you get:Same concept but a different USM (500%, 30px) blended in Darken:So what would we get if we mix the two?Exactly what you would have expected – that’s it, we’re done splitting dark and light halos.",
        "With a caveat: what if we reverse the layer’s order (Lighten top, Darken bottom)?Uhm, it doesn’t work anymore. So the trick is to keep the SO with the bigger USM Radius on top of the other – easy peasy.Alas, I should have been more careful, because I’ve based a good deal of coding time on this paradigm (two SO in Darken / Lighten) just to discover that it is flawed. What a unhappy business! Not to mention what my wife has been repeating me (she used to work as a programmer): “Did you test it?",
        "You did it not enough. Test it more or you’ll waste your time later. Don’t complain, I told you this before: test it!” She’s been in charge of testing, as you may guess.But… why it doesn’t work? The example I’ve showed is misleading because as a test it is not exhaustive one: I’ve changed one parameter only – the Radius, keeping the Amount full blast at 500% What happens for instance if I lower back the Amount of Dark halos to 100%?",
        "No matter how I would set the layers order, the result does not match my expectations:First row (Lighten on top) is obviously flawed because it erases the Darken effect – the dark halo is wrong. Middle row (Darken on top) is not correct too, because the light halo is slightly darkened by the dark halo: it’s subtle because I’ve used a low Amount. Check out the last row to compare them with the right effect.",
        "Back to square one.Multiple Smart FiltersA single SO can support more than one SF (how many, frankly I don’t know). A nice idea could be to apply two rounds of USM as SF to the same SO, fading them to Darken / Lighten. To fade a SF, click on the “lines-and-arrows” icon at the right of the “Unsharp Mask” label of the Smart Filter.There’s a detail that prevent this one to work, though.",
        "SFs don’t operate in parallel, but in sequence: that is, the first USM round acts on the original SO (as expected); the second USM round operates on the result of the first SF, i.e. upon an already sharpened version. No matter how you set the SF stack order (in the following image: first Darken top, second Lighten top), the result is wrong.So what?As a consequence of these experiments and in a bad mood for the time wasted coding a flawed paradigm (lesson learned: test extensively!",
        "Don’t get excited when things apparently work!), I’ve had to resort to some… trickier solutions – which I’ll show you in the next post of the series.The Decomposing Sharpening series has been written as a research project for my script DoubleUSM: multi-radius sharpening.

        "Died: 15 January, 2013, in Edinburgh, aged 59Susan Manning was an intellectual dynamo whose love of words generated an influence that extended around the world.As Grierson Professor of English Literature and director of the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities (IASH) at Edinburgh University, her contribution was huge, but beyond that, she was known internationally through her work on transatlantic literature, the Scottish Enlightenment and with the Confucius Institute.An academic with a rare knack of seamlessly combining her talents as a scholar, manager and mentor, she was a brilliant researcher, inspiring teacher and an excellent administrator and organiser, yet remained humble in success.The daughter of medical physicist James Valentine and his wife Honora, a philosophy graduate, she was educated at John Mason High School in Abingdon near Oxford, after her parents had moved south when she was nine.",
        "As a teenager she excelled in science and humanities, achieving perfect O-level grades in both fields. But she followed her instincts at A-level, deciding to study English. Literature’s gain greatly exceeded science’s loss.After capping her schooldays with an exceptional final year, in which she became head girl, she took the then unusual step of taking a gap year.",
        "She spent time visiting Canada and Paris and Grenoble in France before going up to read English at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she graduated with a BA in 1976, around the same time as marrying physicist Howard Manning.She then embarked on a PhD on Scottish and American literature, studying in the National Library of Scotland and then winning a Harkness Fellowship, which took her to Charlottesville in Virginia where she studied under distinguished Americanist David Levin.",
        "She and Howard went on to have their first child, Laura, in the States. On her return to Cambridge, she took up a research fellowship at Newnham College in 1981, becoming a college lecturer in 1984 and later faculty lecturer.She also continued her doctorate studies, gaining her PhD in 1986 and joking that it had not taken ten years but three children – with Lindsay and Sophie having completed her family.",
        "Remaining at Newnham for the best part of 20 years, she skilfully pursued her career in English along with motherhood; Sophie attended her first college seminar in a carrycot, aged just three weeks.Following a bout of meningitis, Prof Manning was diagnosed with lupus but, undeterred, continued to live as full a life as possible.",
        "Latterly she ignored her lack of circulation to spend three hours snorkelling on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef – an experience that rendered the great wordsmith almost speechless.In 1999 she moved to Edinburgh to take up the Grierson Chair in English Literature.",
        "She also held the directorship of IASH there for seven years, from 2005, having previously been research director and postgraduate director in the School of Literatures, Languages and Cultures.A serious bowel operation, a lung disease and the ravages of lupus failed to slow her and she made IASH a vibrant centre for multidisciplinary studies.",
        "It gave full scope to her administrative genius and range of interdisciplinary skills – and afforded her an international reach.She was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, as well as a Trustee of the Kennedy Memorial Trust, which sends scholars to further study in the US, and the Rothschild Fellowships in Jerusalem.In addition she was a trustee of Edinburgh University Press, and a member of the Gifford Lectureships committee and the research committee of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences.",
        "She also served on the advisory board of the Edinburgh Confucius Institute and of several scholarly editions and journals including the Edinburgh edition of the Waverley Novels, the Stirling/South Carolina edition of the Works of James Hogg, and the Cambridge University Press Studies in Romanticism series.She co-edited a monograph series on transatlantic literary studies and was a board member and past president of the Eighteenth-Century Scottish Studies Society and a board member of the international body, the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes.Her own research interests were primarily in the Scottish Enlightenment and in Scottish-American literary relations, the subjects of her books The Puritan-Provincial Vision and the transatlantic study Fragments of Union.",
        "She co-ordinated the Carnegie-funded STAR (Scotland’s Transatlantic Relations) initiative and convened its seminar and research projects. Along with Dr Nicholas Phillipson she also convened a three-year research project on The Science of Man in Scotland, funded by the Leverhulme Trust, which led to an essay collection on Character, Self and Sociability in the Scottish Enlightenment.Her monograph on The Poetics of Character: A Transatlantic Literary History will be published posthumously.",
        "She completed it in the Old Lobster House, in Lower Burnmouth, near Eyemouth, which she and her husband had recently completed refurbishing.Her premature death, following a stroke, has been felt keenly around the world by those who admired a woman whose charm, intellect, humanity and generosity left an imprint on countless colleagues and former students.Prof Manning was buried in woodland on Edinburgh’s Corstorphine Hill after a service full of poems, reminiscence and music, including her beloved Bach cello suites, which she always said straightened out her brain waves.She is survived by her husband, Dr Howard Manning, their daughters, Laura, Lindsay and Sophie, granddaughter Poppy, her mother Honora, sister Claire and brother John.Almost Done!By registering you are agreeing to the Terms and Conditions of the website."

        "- Fellowships- Resources- News Collaborative- Community- Blogs- Stories- WebinarsHealth Challenges Faced by Midwestern Latino Communities: Lessons Learned from my Hunt Fellowship.July 05, 2012At we have a motto that we like to shoot for the moon and see how far we get.Our Dennis A. Hunt Fellowship proposal was conceived and written in that spirit.",
        "We set out to write a trio of stories that all dealt with health issues faced by communities in the Midwest that had seen an increase in their Latino populations in the past decade.",
        "Our proposal said we would write stories about the degree to which federal agencies did or did not protect workers and their families in these areas, would look at access to health insurance in a couple of Chicago neighborhoods that had high numbers of Latino residents working full time, and would delve into the issue of trauma and resilience resulting from migrants’ journeys north.For the enforcement piece our objective was to build a that we would combine with census, jobs and environmental databases and food recalls.",
        "Our intention was to use what we built not only to create a new and unprecedented resource that we would share with our readers for their own searches, but also to identify companies that we would investigate in depth. The insurance piece drew on a national analysis we had done of data from the U.S.",
        "Census Bureau, and the trauma and resilience piece would be based in part on information and resources I had gained access to through my membership and participation in the andWe also sought to publish blog posts, videos, maps, court documents and others throughout the project, rather than wait until the end, and to forge collaborative relationships with other news publications.Finally, we wanted to look at these issues from a community-wide, rather than individual, perspective.Our project did not turn our precisely as we had planned.We did indeed acquire the data mentioned above from OSHA and the EPA, and did blend this data with other data sources to which we had gained access.",
        "However, despite spending a lot of time on this effort, our enforcement story did not come from this route.Instead, we followed editor suggestion and of Wright County Egg in Galt, Iowa. In August 2010 the company was the subject of the largest egg recall in United States history. We and found that Jack DeCoster, the company owner, had a more than of e, a substantial portion of which involved his conscious policy of hiring undocumented Mexican workers for their work ethic and vulnerability.",
        "In addition to finding a staggering lack of communication between federal agencies, we also we were able to raise the question if these workers were the proverbial “canary in the coal mine.” The implication was that more attention to undocumented workers’ conditions and safety could perhaps have averted the later consumer disaster and recall.We also used the occasion of a seeming enforcement success, the closure of a notoriously filthy and dangerous migrant worker camp in Rantoul, Illinois due to a collective effort from largely local enforcement agencies, advocates, service providers and media.",
        "that while the closure of Cherry Orchard was indeed an accomplishment and even a model for other communities, it did very little to change in any fundamental way the experience of those migrant workers.The insurance story was a bit more straightforward.Here we learned and the many creative ways full-time workers use to meet their health care needs and other pressing financial responsibilities like the rent and food.",
        "For example, we met a woman who had to choose one night between eating and buying medicine for a sick child.She bought the medicine.For the trauma and resilience story, we traveled to Beardstown, Illinois, which in 2007 was the site of a massive immigration raid at the Cargill plant. We thought Beardstown made sense because the raid was a universally shared and searing event that still was very much alive in the hearts and heads of the town’s Latino community.",
        "From that story we connected with Julio Flores, an El Salvadoran community activist who had to flee his country, but who had worked diligently in the town for 15 years to develop its sense of strength through cultural celebrations. y gave us new insight into communal trauma and the ways in which one can heal from it.We did indeed publish as we went , and . We published mostly in Spanish, but had seven posts in English, too. Althoguh we reached out to a number of possible collaborators.",
        "We did not succeed in getting other outlets to use the data we provided to them as the basis for their stories. But the project did help us forge a deeper relationship with , a non-profit outfit at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with whom we are doing a project that will build on this reporting.",
        "It also gave us the material necessary to and give us the material to connect with ProPublica about working with them.We also used for the first time to annotate the story about Wright County Egg.Finally, we published online line stories in the week before we came out with an eight-page print supplement that had the four major stories delineated above as well as profiles of people we met through the course of our reporting whose experiences resonated with the theme and content of the story with which it was paired.We did not reach the moon and are still hearing from the community members about the work, but we did do a number of things we had never done before.We did gain valuable information about the experiences of Latino individuals and communities in the Midwest.And we were able to paint a collective portrait of a richly diverse community many of whose members are struggling within significant constraints both to live a dignified life and to meet their families’ often pressing health care needs.We will continue to explore these critical issues and are grateful for the opportunity granted to use through the fellowship and our participation in the ReportingonHealth community.Tips for Other Reporters:- Sharpen the point, but be open to the twists and turns in the road.- Comb data and don’t get lost in the “rabbit hole” of data analysis.",
        "Try to remember the bigger picture.- Link individuals’ stories to policy and, if possible, to evidence that warnings have been given about the issue at hand.- Think of the stories on their own and as part of a greater whole.- Don’t forget the people. They are who it’s about and they are who the readers want to learn from in the project.- Don’t be afraid of reaching far, and remember to keep your feet on the ground."

Today was perfect with it starting as I was getting to work and stopping right before lunch. I've mostly been concerned about keeping warm here lately and I want to tell you that the Pottery Barn bedset I invested in is the best thing I have bought since I can remember. I have not gotten even the least bit chilly under it.",

It's chilly in the mornings but then again that's how it should be in the wintertime. We used to see who could get closest to the fireplace or fuel oil stove as a kid first thing on a frosty morning. That's what you called cold when everything fizzled out at night and the house was actually froze in the mornings :o) You can see a picture of my bedset with a link here.",
        "Love it!As far as warm clothing, I always wear tights or thin leggings under jeans with my Ugg boots when it's really cold. I usually go with three layers on top. I did pick myself up a pair of skinny jeans I was going to wear with my new Ugg's today but the snow came. I did pick out a lovely embroidered top I got for practically nothing on ebay. If you don't shop on ebay for used clothing you should. Avoid electronics though, I haven't had luck with those.",
        "I paired the top with a long, thick sweater and I am warm as a bug in a rug today. But then again I have the furnace cranked too ♥It's so nice to hear from you. Thanks for stopping by!"

        "NBA Trade Rumors: Latest Buzz on Carmelo Anthony, Brandon Knight and MoreJuly 17, 2017The 2017 edition of the NBA offseason has been an entertaining one. While it's often the NFL that commands the summer offseason, basketball has remained front and center ever since the end of the NBA Finals.The offseason began with a stellar draft class and some headline-grabbing trades and has continued to shine throughout an entertaining summer league.",
        "Even as we enter the second half of July, media attention remains high thanks to the possibility of some more notable moves.Many of the biggest tradable players of the offseason—like Chris Paul, Paul George and Jimmy Butler—have already been moved. However, there are still some notable guys who could be traded. We're here to examine the latest trade buzz as the offseason continues.Carmelo Trade Still a PossibilityCarmelo Anthony remains the most notable name on the trade market.",
        "He was the subject of trade rumors before Phil Jackson was ousted as team president, and he remains at the center of them even now. The reason for this is that Anthony is an aging veteran, and the New York Knicks are looking toward yet another rebuild.The fact Anthony is set to earn $54 million over the next two seasons doesn't exactly help his value with the retooling Knicks either.However, ESPN's Ramona Shelburne and Adrian Wojnarowski reported last week that the Knicks were putting trade talks on hold.",
        "The team had been involved in talks with both the Houston Rockets and the Cleveland Cavaliers—the two teams Anthony is interested in joining via trade.Anthony holds a no-trade clause in his current contract.While Shelburne and Wojnarowski reported that the Knicks are interested in getting Anthony to return to the team, this doesn't mean a trade won't eventually happen.",
        "In fact, per Wojnarowski, Anthony is counting on the Knicks to resume talks him, league sources said.\"The one thing the Knicks may be able to rely on is the fact Anthony previously expressed his desire to remain in New York in order to be close to his son. It's not as if the team can sell him on championship aspirations.",
        "The team can, however, try selling him on a playing environment.Trail Blazers, McCollum Getting in on the Carmelo ChaseThe Cavaliers and the Rockets are the two teams Anthony has expressed interest in joining this offseason. However, that hasn't stopped other teams—or individual players—from trying to recruit Anthony.The Portland Trail Blazers had previously been linked to Anthony as part of a three-team deal involving New York and Houston.",
        "However, Wojnarowski recently reported that Portland would instead prefer to land Anthony:.\"Portland squeaked into the playoffs last season with a .500 record, so it might be presumptuous for the team to believe it can compete with the likes of the Golden State Warriors and the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference just be adding Anthony.",
        "However, it the Trail Blazers do feel they can be title contenders with Anthony, it would make zero sense to facilitate his trade to Houston.Trail Blazers shooting guard C.J. McCollum got in on the recruiting action—and had a little bit of fun—over the weekend.",
        "He posted a Photoshopped picture of Anthony wearing a Portland uniform on his Instagram account, tagging Anthony in the photo.While McCollum's post isn't likely to sway Anthony too much, it might be a reminder that some teams want him—after the Knicks spend a large part of the offseason acting like they don't.Knicks Looking to Add a Point GuardWhile the Knicks may ultimately trade away Anthony, they're also reportedly looking to acquire talent.",
        "According to Ian Begley of ESPN, New York is looking to add a point guard. Per Begley, Brandon Knight of the Phoenix Suns has come up in trade discussions, both as an addition and as part of a Carmelo deal:.\"Knight averaged 11.0 points, 2.4 assists and 2.2 rebounds per game last season.",
        "He would presumably be a short-term option as New York develops rookie point guard Frank Ntilikina.Marc Berman of the New York Post reported last week that the Knicks had inquired about both Bledsoe and free agent Ramon Sessions.Sessions would likely be a last-ditch value option for the Knicks, assuming the team is looking for a starting point guard. The 31-year-old averaged just 16.2 minutes and 6.2 points per game last season.",
        "Knight and Bledsoe—who averaged 21.1 points and 6.3 assists last season—would appear to be better primary options."

        "The life of a pro wrestler is a hectic one. Muscled up, often steroid-filled, testosterone-raging men who travel the globe on a regular basis can get a little grumpy from time-to-time. At times, these guys can lose their cool and get into altercations with each other.",
        "In part two of a new editorial series here at eWrestlingNews.com, “Backstage Fight Stories,” we’re going to take a look at another infamous behind-the-scenes brawl that involved two well-known professional wrestlers.As I get older and the business continues to move ahead, I’m learning more and more that the fan base is filled with a lot of younger fans. I’m learning that stories I’ve heard, that I assume are common-knowledge to all wrestling fans, are actually brand new to this generation.",
        "So while you and I may remember these stories as if they happened yesterday, we have to understand that thousands upon thousands of younger fans have never heard of them. If you have, then enjoy reading about them again. If you haven’t, strap on your seat belts because some of them will shock the hell out of you. Today, in part two of our “Backstage Fight Stories” series, we will take a look at Scott Steiner vs.",
        "Diamond Dallas Page.Scott Carl Rechsteiner, who performed during his pro wrestling career as Scott Steiner, was a legitimate amateur wrestler before entering the “professional” level. Rechsteiner wrestled at 190 pounds for the University of Michigan, where he became a three-time Big 10 runner-up after finishing fifth in his freshman year in college.",
        "He later became a NCAA Division I All-American and placed sixth in the United States in his senior year.Page Joseph Falkinburg, who performed during his pro wrestling career as Diamond Dallas Page (DDP), was originally an aspiring basketball player. Fulkinburg played basketball at St. Joseph’s High School (which is now known as Monsignor Donovan High School) during his freshman year on the junior varsity team, and on the varsity squad as a sophomore.",
        "Falkinburg later became a mainstay in the nightclub industry before becoming a full-fledged pro wrestler at an older age than most talents who enter the business.Steiner and Page both worked in WCW during the heyday of the infamous WWE vs. WCW “Monday Night Wars.” Things between the two reached a boiling point in 2001 when Kimberly Page, DDP’s wife at the time, found an illegal substance backstage and allegedly went to WCW management, informing them that it belonged to Tammy “Sunny” Sytch.",
        "Sytch denied the accusation and even offered to take a drug test on the spot — which she ended up passing. This is where things got interesting.Apparently Steiner caught wind of what was happening and literally chased Kimberly out of the building. Subsequently, Kimberly would never appear on WCW television again.At the following television taping, Steiner cut a shoot promo on Page, who at this point was fed up and felt the need to stand up for not only his wife, but himself as a man.",
        "Page ended up waiting for Steiner backstage after he cut the aforementioned televised promo, and this is where all hell broke loose.As the story goes, DDP, who was waiting for Steiner behind the curtain, confronted the former NCAA Division I All-American wrestler as soon as he made his way backstage. The two allegedly exchanged some heated verbal insults before things got physical.",
        "Apparently the two ended up in a clinch, and depending on multiple versions of the story, DDP put a front-face-lock of sorts, or a guillotine choke by today’s mixed-martial-arts standards, on the larger grappler. The two were supposedly separated, but unfortunately for DDP the situation didn’t end there.Again, there are a number of variations to the story, but apparently Steiner broke free from those holding him back at the time and allegedly went completely berserk.",
        "Page, who tried throwing a kick at Steiner, ended up on the ground as the result of a double-leg-dive, or a traditional amateur-style takedown from the man with the legitimate wrestling experience. Here’s where things got ugly, and where details become a bit scarce.Steiner reportedly went for DDP’s eyes. That’s right, Steiner tried ripping DDP’s eyeballs out of the socket, rendering the “People’s Champion” at the time (Page was calling himself that before “The Rock” was in WWE) blind.",
        "Going for the eyes in a legitimate fight is one of many tricks professional wrestlers were taught in the old days when instructed how to really “handle yourself” in a legitimate altercation. “The eyes are the groin of the face,” as was once referenced as a joke on the hit-comedy television series “The Office.”While it may have served as a joke for the documentary-style television series, truer words have never been spoken. Anyone who has taken a solid shot to the ball-bag knows — game over.",
        "At least temporarily. In this case, where several other muscled up bad asses were there to break things up, the game was over for good. DDP allegedly bit Steiner in an attempt to get “The Big Bad Booty Daddy” off of him, and the two were once again separated.DDP, who had come off as a hero to his fellow WCW employees for standing up to someone who was perceived as a bully, and during the initial scuffle reportedly looked to be holding his own in an impressive fashion, was a mess.",
        "His face was apparently in bad shape, with obvious damage suffered during their brief exchanges. Page later claimed that his face resembled “Freddy Krueger” from the popular horror movie series, “A Nightmare On Elm Street.”For those who would like to hear Diamond Dallas Page tell his version of the story, click here to listen to an excerpt from a radio interview where he spends about five minutes discussing the legitimate backstage fight with Steiner.So there you have it.",
        "Join us next time where we will take a look at another real-life fight in the not-so-real world of professional wrestling.",
        "Until next time, this has been another installment of the eWrestlingNews.com ongoing series, “Backstage Fight Stories.”For those who missed it, click here to check out the first installment of “Backstage Fight Stories,” which features the story of the legitimate fight between Sid Vicious and Arn Anderson, where both guys ended up in the emergency room after being stabbed with a pair of scissors.."

        "We've been living in a COVID world for more than 18 months now.",
        "At the outset of the pandemic, government agencies and health authorities scrambled to inform people on how to identify symptoms of the virus.But as the virus has evolved, it seems the most common symptoms have changed too.Emerging data suggest people infected with the Delta variant - the variant behind most of Australia's current cases and highly prevalent around the world - are experiencing symptoms different to those we commonly associated with COVID earlier in the pandemic.We're all differentHumans are dynamic.",
        "With our differences come different immune systems. This means the same virus can produce different signs and symptoms in different ways.A sign is something that's seen, such as a rash. A symptom is something that's felt, like a sore throat.The way a virus causes illness is dependent on two key factors:viral factors include things like speed of replication, modes of transmission, and so on. Viral factors change as the virus evolves.host factors are specific to the individual.",
        "Age, gender, medications, diet, exercise, health and stress can all affect host factors.So when we talk about the signs and symptoms of a virus, we're referring to what is most common. To ascertain this, we have to collect information from individual cases.It's important to note this data is not always easy to collect or analyze to ensure there's no bias.",
        "For example, older people may have different symptoms to younger people, and collecting data from patients in a hospital may be different to patients at a GP clinic.So what are the common signs and symptoms of the Delta variant?Using a self-reporting system through a mobile app, data from the United Kingdom suggest the most common COVID symptoms may have changed from those we traditionally associated with the virus.The reports don't take into account which COVID variant participants are infected with.",
        "But given Delta is predominating in the UK at present, it's a safe bet the symptoms we see here reflect the Delta variant.(The Conversation/CC BY ND)While fever and cough have always been common COVID symptoms, and headache and sore throat have traditionally presented for some people, a runny nose was rarely reported in earlier data. Meanwhile, loss of smell, which was originally quite common, now ranks ninth.There are a few reasons we could be seeing the symptoms evolving in this way.",
        "It may be because data were originally coming mainly from patients presenting to hospital who were therefore likely to be sicker. And given the higher rates of vaccination coverage in older age groups, younger people are now accounting for a greater proportion of COVID cases, and they tend to experience milder symptoms.It could also be because of the evolution of the virus, and the different characteristics (viral factors) of the Delta variant.",
        "But why exactly symptoms could be changing remains uncertain.While we still have more to learn about the Delta variant, this emerging data is important because it shows us that what we might think of as just a mild winter cold - a runny nose and a sore throat - could be a case of COVID-19.This data highlight the power of public science. At the same time, we need to remember the results haven't yet been fully analysed or stratified.",
        "That is, \"host factors\" such as age, gender, other illnesses, medications and so on haven't been accounted for, as they would in a rigorous clinical trial.And as is the case with all self-reported data, we have to acknowledge there may be some flaws in the results.Does vaccination affect the symptoms?Although new viral variants can compromise the effectiveness of vaccines, for Delta, the vaccines available in Australia (Pfizer and AstraZeneca) still appear to offer good protection against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses.Importantly, both vaccines have been shown to offer greater than 90 percent protection from severe disease requiring hospital treatment.A recent \"superspreader\" event in New South Wales highlighted the importance of vaccination.",
        "Of 30 people who attended this birthday party, reports indicated none of the 24 people who became infected with the Delta variant had been vaccinated.",
        "The six vaccinated people at the party did not contract COVID-19.In some cases infection may still possible after vaccination, but it's highly likely the viral load will be lower and symptoms much milder than they would without vaccination.We all have a role to playEvidence indicating Delta is more infectious compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 and other variants of the virus is building.It's important to understand the environment is also changing.",
        "People have become more complacent with social distancing, seasons change, vaccination rates vary - all these factors affect the data.But scientists are becoming more confident the Delta variant represents a more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 strain.As we face another COVID battle in Australia we're reminded the war against COVID is not over and we all have a role to play. Get tested if you have any symptoms, even if it's \"just a sniffle\".",

        "Jurgen Klopp on Cristiano Ronaldo incident.Jurgen Klopp has said that he didn’t want Cristiano Ronaldo to be sent off for a foul on Curtis Jones on Sunday afternoon.The Liverpool manager watched his side tear Manchester United apart as the visitors came away from Old Trafford with a 5-0 victory over their arch-rivals.Towards the end of the first half, with Liverpool leading 3-0, Man United players were already showing signs of frustration and none more so than their star man Ronaldo.In a duel with youngster Curtis Jones, the Liverpool man ended up on the ground before Ronaldo began kicking the ball into his midriff, leading to anger from several of Jones’ teammates./>Jurgen Klopp: I was told it was fine.Referee Anthony Taylor decided that the incident was only worth a yellow card for Ronaldo and after the situation was eased, Liverpool went up to the other end of the pitch to score a fourth first-half goal.Asked about the foul afterwards, Klopp was magnanimous towards the five-time Ballon d’Or winner, who rejoined United over the summer.““I saw it of course,” the German coach told reporters after the match.“For me it looked like it a red card but in the end I got told it wasn’t because he made contact with the ball.",

Deval Patrick signed the measure on Aug.",
        "12 that provides funding for water infrastructure improvements in the state. Phelan was one of the supporters of the bill who spoke during the legislative debate on it at the State House earlier this year.\"The language in it (bill) gives us the potential to receive a grant from the state,\" Phelan said.Phelan explained that an amendment supported by Holbrook's legislators, Rep. Mark Cusack, Sen. Brian Joyce, and Sen.",
        "John Keenan would give the town an edge in either joining the MWRA or staying with Tri-Town and paying a share of building a new treatment plant in Randolph that would replace the existing aging facility.The town has been negotiating with both the Tri-Town Water Board and the MWRA in trying to find the best cost-effective water distribution source.Selectmen approved to send a letter of interest to the MWRA formally notifying the authority that Holbrook is interested in negotiating joining the state system.Phelan said that the MWRA is aware of Holbrook's situation with Tri-Town and the legislation that provides an incentive to build a new treatment plant.",
        "He added that the MWRA is interested in negotiating with the Holbrook.\"They are anxious to provide water to us,\" he said.The sticking point to joining the MWRA is the tie-in fee and necessary infrastructure upgrades that would cost Holbrook several million dollars, according to officials.Phelan said the new legislation that would match Holbrook's cost of building a new treatment plant or regional water system tie-in fee could give the town an edge with the MWRA.\"We could say (to the MWRA) absorb the costs of the infrastructure and entrance fee and we will buy water from you,\" he said.",
        "\"We will approach the MWRA one last time (with the proposal).\"Tri-Town wants to build a new plant to replace the antiquated Randolph facility.Holbrook has balked at paying one-third of the construction cost, an agreement that goes back more than 100 years where Randolph, Braintree, and Holbrook each share equally all associated costs of the water distribution system.Holbrook officials have argued that the cost should be based on usage.",
        "Phelan noted that Holbrook uses the least amount of water.Phelan said that he recently got initial approval from Tri-Town that Holbrook would pay 15 percent of the plant's construction cost and 11 percent of operational costs thereafter.Page 2 of 2 - \"It was a compromise,\" Phelan said.He also noted that under the Holbrook-Randolph Joint Water Board agreement, Holbrook pays half the costs.\"We've been subsidizing production of water for Randolph for over 100 years,\" Phelan said.",
        "\"We pay 50 percent of the cost when we utilize 25 percent of the water.\"He noted that Holbrook has been negotiating for a long while with both Tri-Town and the MWRA.\"The delay (in making a decision) will ultimately benefit us,\" Phelan said.He noted that the Legislature just approved the SouthField bill in Weymouth that allows the development at the former South Weymouth Naval Air Station to tie into the MWRA.",
        "Phelan said Holbrook, Randolph, and Braintree could be compensated from this should the water line run through the three towns.Phelan said that negotiations are to continue with both the MWRA and Tri-Town and expects a resolution soon.\"It's the MWRA or the plant,\" Phelan said. \"It's an issue that would affect our residents for years and years to come.\""

        "1. Alba Botanica Exfoliating ScrubThis is marketed as a facial exfoliation product, however I actually use it for my feet. I have sensitive skin, and it was causing my face to break out. I am phasing it out of my shower because it leaves large chunks of gooey-sand that dry and stick to the tub. I never seem to notice them when I’m showering, but whenever my daughters take a bath or I’m cleaning the bathtub, I really notice how much this product builds up in the tubs basin and on the ledges.2.",
        "Aveno’s Simply RadiantThis product is amazing. It smells wonderful, leaves my face glowing, soft, and best of all feeling healthy. I usually apply this after my facial cleanse (#3). My face has never felt better!3. Nuetrogena’s Stress Releif Acne ScrubI have very sensitive skin and it’s been hard to find a cleanser that actually gets the job done. When things get really stressful my face tends to break out, and this scrub has been remarkable.",
        "It has stopped the breakouts and cleared up any spots of acne that have already appeared. I follow it up with a skin toner (#2).4. Up&Up’s Soy Shave gelThis product is found exclusively at Target. You’ll hear me talk about the Up&Up brand a lot because I’m a big fan of it. They are low cost good quality products. This particular product leaves my skin smooth with a nice natural scent to follow.5.",
        "Yardly’s Mango Shower GelI give this a thumbs down because while it does smell great, I am phasing it out of my shower. It doesn’t really leave a fresh feeling or fragrance behind, but rather lathers and disappears completely leaving the experience completely unmemorable. I’m still scouting for that perfect body wash that leaves my skin feeling soft and smelling good!6. Garnier Fructis’s Sleek and Shine Shampoo and ConditionerI have used this product for years.",
        "It smells wonderful, leaves my hair feeling healthy and strong, and best of all it doesn’t give you that waxy buildup that other products do but does give you all the shine!7. MassagersThis are a good add to any shower, especially after a long day. Warm water and something to work out the kinks in your lower back and shoulders is just what the doctor ordered! Can usually find these in your bath isle at your local retail chains.8.",
        "Exfoliating GloveThese are wonderful to use for your feet, elbows, knees, and any other place you get dry skin. I usually apply some body wash and work it into a lather using this glove. Goodbye dead skin, hello good feelings!9. Munckin tub cupThis handy tub-cup is made of a very flexible rubber. This is super helpful for when you need to rinse out the shampoo from your kids hair (press the cup to their forehead and it bends to ensure water will not get into their eyes).",
        "I store mine upside down from my shower caddy to ensure it dries and does not collect mildew and standing water.10. Crayola color-changing loufasThis is a very fun way to get your kids excited about lathering away their dirty day. These loufas change color when they heat up (from pink to white). It’s fun to put a little magic into bath-time."

        "Taking the last question first: crime up, murders way up, education dropping even more than its Third World rating would predict, corruption up, jobs down, economy tanking, government bond debt limit reached, government credit rating dropping, stupid political leaders playing kissie-assie with each other, emigration rising...",
        "If anyone thinks the current sewage dump of \"\"\"leaders\"\"\" is going to change their thieving, me-first bullshit, then they are retarded and should not vote.As for why a voter movement and not some other \"peaceful\" process: short of a violent overthrow and non-existent recall solutions, the simplest and most direct path to change Our (non)government is through the elections.",
        "Since every electoral office is up for grabs every 4 years, the only real chance We have to make minimal or wholesale changes is at the ballot box.Moving on. The voter movement I envision would obviously have to cross party lines, galvanize abut 350,000 - 425,000 votes and focus on taking out entrenched Fools.Why?1) Cross party lines: The average voter wants to feel that his or her vote \"wins\" in some way.",
        "Appealing to only one party or ideology group will cause the average voter (species name: Voticus ignoramus) to fear that their vote will \"be wasted.\" Of course, they don't see that voting for anyone already elected is \"wasting\" their vote because those already in power are parasites living off Our indifference.2) Galvanize 350,000-425,000 voters: The average election in Puerto Rico has about an 85% turnout and that means about 1.8 million votes cast.",
        "Twenty percent of that number is 360,000, a substantial number that will cause all Fools to take the voter movement extremely seriously. Especially when the movement focuses on point 3...3) Taking out entrenched Fools: There are folks in Our government that have the morals of an opium fiend with the willies, the ethical standards of a child-molesting priest and the intellectual development of week-old gumbo.",
        "Yet these scumbuckets are making decisions about Our economy (crashing), Our education (crashed), Our taxes (crushing) and thus Our future (crushed.) For that privilege, We are paying many of them salary and benefit packages that are simply ridiculous when compared to Our averages: mayors making over $100,000 a year, legislators making over $110,000, Cabinet officials over $190,000 and even support staff is making over $80,000.",
        "And what about consultants making over $125,000 on each of two or three \"legitimate\" contracts?By attacking the incumbents, the voter movement automatically becomes one \"of change, for change.\" Rather than attack all the incumbents, a series of targets are selected, primarily from the legislature.",
        "(Folks, I don't capitalize words for institutions I don't have at least a modicum of respect.) To make the biggest change, targets from each major party are selected and the criteria are simple: Those holding key legislative positions (president, vicepresident, speaker of each chamber, etc.) and those with the longest incumbencies (long-term parasites.)A quick scan means that media tumors and crap merchants like Jenniffer \"Gluttonny\" González and Tomás \"Mad Dog\" Rivera would be targeted alongside commonwealth party tapeworms like Antonio \"You Haven't Caught Me\" Fas and José \"I Look Up to Tapeworms\" Varela.",
        "As the statehood party currently controls the legislature, there will be more names from that party than from the other, but that's how these changes work: by targeting those who have the most to lose.In that sense, all legislators elected \"by accumulation,\" i.e., not tied to any senatorial or representational district, are the best targets, for they are often \"\"\"party leaders\"\"\" who use their \"\"widespread mandate\"\"\" to fuck Us. (Notice the absolute lack of quotation marks around fuck Us.",
        "Twice.)Also amongst the targets are certain mayors, who have become entrenched to the point of idiocy. Two examples are Carlos \"I'm A Businessman Like the Mafia Is a Brotherhood\" Méndez, of Aguadilla and José \"City Hall Is My Closet\" Rodríguez, of Mayagüez. Why them?",
        "because they've been in that chair for over 12 years; their time is past, if it ever was.The voter movement would focus on kicking out incumbents, targeting them with direct questions, deep analysis of their shortcomings and raising awareness of how utterly useless these high-profile, long-squatting pisspots are.",
        "Rather than trying to change the entire political system, the voter movement would narrow its focus to a true leverage position: shaking the foundation of the most ambitious and entrenched.Nothing strikes more fear into the heart of a Fool--more so than an F.B.I. badge--than a voter group that the Fool cannot buy.",
        "A voter movement aimed at knocking off incumbents, that crosses party lines in order to make changes happen, is a powerful force: when that force is applied well, it makes change inevitable.And once the voter movement proves its worth, it need only target other high-profile, long-squatting smegmacups to make them pay attention to Us. Because that's the whole point of this voter movement: to make the Fools understand that they work for Us and that We hold the power, not them.A name?",
        "Okay, how about Junta Electoral Nacional Independiente Organizada: JENIO.Yeah, I know that's \"Jenius\" in Spanish, but it does have a certain ring to it, dissonant yet affecting.However, for populist appeal, We could go with Movimiento Pa' Fuera, the Get Out Movement.I know, Brethren: the trilling rhythms of \"¡Pa' fuera, pa' la calle!\" are already ringing in your ears...The Jenius Has Spoken.2 comments:Make it happen! ;)I'm looking into it, Joe..."

        "Jeff Larson defends use of RNC funds [INTERVIEW]By Andy Mannix and Mike MullenIn 2008, St. Paul hosted the Republican National Convention. Republican strategist Jeff Larson was the CEO and treasurer of the host committee, which raised $65 million prior to the four-day event (Read this week's feature, RNC Piggy Bank).",
        "After the convention left town and its debts were paid, the host committee still had a surplus of more than $7 million.Though the bulk would go to charity, a number of individuals and companies continued to receive payments from the surplus years after the convention. Several campaign finance experts who analyzed the expenditure reports for City Pages say the pattern of spending so long after the convention is abnormal, and deserves an explanation.For this we went to Larson, the man in charge.",
        "Larson declined to be interviewed over the phone, but agreed to answer questions via e-mail. Larson did not respond to questions about payments made to specific individuals after the convention. Here's an abbreviated version of what he would tell us:City Pages: Can you start by explaining who selected you to be CEO of the 2008 Republican National Convention Host Committee? Why were you interested in taking this job?Jeff Larson: I believed the Twin Cities needed a shot in the arm.",
        "It had been a long time since the Minneapolis St Paul had hosted anything nearly as large as the National Convention. You would have to go back to the Super Bowl in 1991 since we were on the national stage......Since it was the Republican Convention that decided to come here, and since the Host Committee needed someone who knew the community and knew the workings of the RNC, they asked me to take this position.",
        "I did it to help ensure Minneapolis Saint Paul put on a world-class Convention that put us on the map with other convention cities like Chicago, Boston, New York, New Orleans, Denver and Los Angeles. We did exactly that thanks to our Board, our team, and the community.CP: It's been more than two years now since the convention, and the host committee still exists.",
        "Why has the committee not closed yet?JL: The short answer is the Federal Elections Commission had not allowed us to do soCP: You told National Journal reporter Ed Pound in 2008 that your position as CEO of the committee was unpaid. Why?JL: I was brought on as the Chief Executive Officer of the Host Committee on July 1, 2007. According to the written Consulting Agreement, I could be reimbursed for expenses but draw no consulting fee or payment.",
        "I was eligible for a discretionary bonus at the conclusion of the convention based on the Board's view of how well I achieved certain goals and if there was any money left over.On July 21, 2009, the Board of Directors held an Executive Session to discuss my performance as Chief Executive Officer of the Host Committee. At that time, I had served as the CEO for over 2 years. The Board voted to pay me $400,000 for this work.Sponsor Content"

        "The half days are because Wednesday is by contract the long staff meeting day and the half days allow for more time for professional development.Parent conferences will be shifted to one full day (Dec. 8) with one additional half day and evening conferences (Dec. 13.) The half day of conferences will be held from 1 p.m.- 4 p.m. There will be a break from dinner and teachers will come back for evening conferences from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The high school will have a full day of professional development on Dec.",

        "Libya military commander blamed for Derna airstrikes01 Nov 2017 - 10:17AATRIPOLI, Libya: Libya’s Justice and Construction Party on Tuesday accused Tobruk-based military commander Khalifa Haftar of carrying out yesterday’s deadly airstrikes in the eastern city of Derna.At least 17 people were killed and dozens more injured when unidentified aircraft struck the city on Monday.In a Tuesday statement, the Muslim Brotherhood-linked party accused Haftar -- who is loyal to Libya’s Tobruk-based government -- of carrying out “terrorist acts” and targeting unarmed civilians in Derna.“Targeting civilians is a war crime and a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law,” the statement read.It went on to urge “all [Libyan] parties… to ensure that the UN and UN Security Council shoulder their responsibility to protect civilians in accordance with international resolutions”.For the last three years, forces commanded by Haftar have kept the city of Derna -- currently held by the Mujahideen Shura Council -- under a crippling siege.Abdulrahman al-Suweihli, head of Libya’s Supreme State Council, also accused Haftar of standing behind this week’s airstrikes in Derna.“We must put political considerations aside and condemn the so-called general command that controls the eastern region,” al-Suweihli tweeted in reference to Haftar and Libya’s Tobruk-based government.In a video statement released Tuesday afternoon, pro-Haftar forces denied any involvement in Monday’s deadly airstrikes.Libya has been dogged by violence and chaos since 2011, when a bloody uprising led to the ouster and death of President Muammar Gaddafi after more than four decades in power.The ensuing power vacuum led to the emergence of several rival seats of government and a plethora of heavily-armed militia groups."

It shows the commitment HTC has to its fan base & the commitment it has for the developer circle also. Motorola will follow in the same footsteps. Motorola would NEVER soil their relationship with their fan base. It’s only a matter of time!11.",
        "The_Miz (Posts: 1496; Member since: 06 Apr 2011)Nothing is void as Motorola are dragging their asses with the announcement. Oh and why not just make good on their promise and release the Droid 3 without locking the bootloader? Because without the unlocked bootloader, the Droid 3 is a subpar phone even though unlocking it won't change that.You won't be able to rid if of the horrible Verizon bloat or change the launcher from that godawful motorblur.I am telling it like it is - Motorola are making excuses.12.",

        "gdubb (unregistered)i don't understand why they waste their time locking the bootloader and mass producing a million products then coming back later and unlocking it, when they could just release it that way, then they could focus on making the phone better and getting out updates faster then worrying about bootloaders. this is all so stupid!"

        "Wedding in Trentino in Northern Italy Sarah and Alessandro’s wedding in Trentino in Northern Italy was one of those epic parties where their personalities, individual style and taste could be seen and felt throughout every moment of the day. Having tied the knot in an official capacity a few years earlier, they finally got around to bringing their family and friends from 12 different countries together in Ale’s hometown for a much anticipated and longed for celebration.",
        "W&E Photographie did a magnificent job and really captured the essence of what this amazing duo are all about. W&E Photographie “Sarah is Brazilian. Ale is Italian. They met in Denmark. Soon after they moved to Norway – Tromsø, in the very tip, top of Norway to be exact. Since their family and friends were all over the world they wanted a wedding where they could all celebrate together. They were more than happy to wait a few years if that’s what it took to get everyone in one place.",
        "Sarah & Ale are the kind of people you just want to be around. The wedding took place in an open field overlooking the foothills of the Italian Alps. This part of Italy is made up of hundreds of tiny towns connected by winding mountain roads. It’s definitely Italy, but the German-Swiss influence can’t be missed. It’s a beautiful blend of cultures and an incredibly charming part of Italy.",
        "In true Italian form, there was a vintage vespa, free-flowing wine & limoncello, and once evening arrived, customary games played by the bride & groom. The couple went for a relaxed and vintage feel for their attire. Sarah and Ale also had a few lovely details made by family and friends to be enjoyed at the reception tucked away in the woods.",
        "We loved being a part of a real Italian wedding – it was such an incredible experience.” From Sarah and Ale Our initial idea was to have two wedding parties: one in Italy where Ale comes from and another in Brazil I am from but we were worried that would divide the family and the friends we have from all over the world because they would have to decide which one of the two parties to go. So we agreed that it would be best to have one single party and northern Italy was chosen.",
        "Ale’s family has a field with a breathtaking view that perfectly matched our vision for the kind of ceremony we wanted, a very relaxed, laid back and family oriented celebration on the mountains of Ale’s childhood. The reception took place in a wooden house in a forest close to the field and it was everything we were hoping for.",
        "We didn’t have a planner or any type of professionals involved (except for our photographers) and so everything was made with the help of friends and family and it couldn’t have been better. Italian weddings have a few unique traditions and we wanted to incorporate some of them into our own day. One of them is that the bride doesn’t walk down the aisle with her bouquet and instead the groom holds it and gives it to her when she gets to the top and we included this one in our own wedding day.",
        "Another tradition that we enjoyed was the one where the Italian friends prepare several games and pranks for the new wed couple. This was a lot of fun and relatively well behaved! We had friends and family coming from 12 different nationalities and it was priceless to see them all together in the one place. Everyone was so happy, enjoying the day with us. It was just amazing!",

I love deviled eggs and egg salad, but I had never made pickled eggs. I first saw these in a buffet prepared by Tellico Kats Deli, where owners Kellye and Tomye shared how they had been eating these since growing up in Pennsylvania. This made more sense when I searched online for recipes and discovered that beet pickled eggs are an Amish dish.",
        "I've adapted my version from several recipes.The recipe can easily be doubled, but my 'new' antique egg server has 12 slots, so I cooked 7 eggs… one for me to eat and the rest cut in halves to serve.",

        "Put the cooked whole eggs into a one-quart canning jar and top with the optional onions.Put the pickling spices into a tea ball, mesh sack, or other strainer. In a saucepan, add the beet juice mix, vinegar, cinnamon stick and pickling spice bag and bring to a boil. Simmer for 10 minutes and stir in the honey. Caution - this mixture will stain, as the finished eggs illustrate.",
        "Wipe up any spills with a disposable wipe, not your favorite dish cloth!Pour the simmered liquid into the jar of eggs while hot (Tip: never pour very hot liquid into a cold jar or you'll risk breaking the jar - and having a dangerous hot liquid pouring out; if necessary, run hot water over the outside of the jar to warm it). Add the spice sack, then put the reserved beet slices on top.",
        "Allow to cool, then cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 24 hours and up to 5 days ahead, giving the eggs time to absorb the color and flavor. If the eggs are too tight against the side of the jar (and still look white), gently insert a narrow rubber spatula into the side of the jar, to maneuver the eggs and liquid around, for more even coloring.When ready to serve, remove the beets and onions with a slotted spoon, draining in a sieve. Discard the spices.",
        "Gently remove the eggs next, setting them on a paper towel in a flat dish so the liquid is absorbed. Discard the pickling liquid. Cut each egg in half, and arrange with the beets on a serving platter.* To hard-boil eggs: Set eggs in a saucepan and cover 1\" over with cold water. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat, keeping covered, and leave for 10 minutes. Pour off the water and run under cold water over the eggs to cool them.",
        "Some say it helps to peel each egg under running water, and finding the thin white membrane right under the shell makes it peel off more easily, in bigger pieces."

        "“Once upon a time there was a dusky maiden named Fudgemella. Her super-power was astro-physics, which in medieval Poland was not much use. The gods had dealt a joker there.”What? Where am I? Did you say Fudgemella?“Caught in a downward fiscal spiral, she began to toy with the idea of branching out, maybe learning a new skill, like Badger-baiting, or popery, which was all the rage.”Hello? What are you talking about?",
        "What’s going on?“As she traipsed through the streets of the generic proto-germanic settlement, she swung her hips seductively, perhaps hoping for some kind of monetary reward. Her gods had done something right with those hips, so the scales appeared balanced. She considered going to Denmark where her super-power might be more useful”Oh God, am I trapped in the consciousness of a bad writer?",
        "Wait, was that a Tycho Brahe reference?“As she passed a group of travelling diplomats (whose employer was in no way related to the events that surrounded Fudgemella’s eventual disappearance, rescue and vindication), she arched her brow, or her eyebrow – it is quite difficult to see from here.”I am trapped in the mind of a bad writer. Hang on, did you just give away the ending? And you’re referencing the writer’s perspective?",
        "Are you mad?“Quite by chance, a knightly knight by the name of Sir Deus arrived. ‘Madam,” he said unto her, forcing the words ‘twixt cup and manly lip, ‘I am Sir Deus. Deus X Machina. The X stands for, er, Ex. I am here to teach you the art of delusion.'”Oh, come on! You’re saying that you actually have a character named –“Fudgemella, startled by the knight’s abrupt/surprising appearance, laughed with gentle admonishment.",
        "‘Sir knight, I have no such need for your teaching, for I have already mastered that particular skill.’ She flicked a bead of sweat from her brow with the last two centimetres of a stiffened digit.If I promise not to criticise will you let me leave?",
        "Please…no more…“The knight, pushed to a rage beyond compare – like that other fellow that got just as angry when someone broke his pencil – charged his mighty steed into the watching diplomats, piercing, quite by happenstance, their hearts with his lance, like a diplomatic kebab. Although that probably shouldn’t be a reference in a period piece. Unless kebabs existed in medieval Poland. Make it a – what do they have in Poland? Sausages?",
        "Yes, pierced their hearts like a mighty polish sausage.”Not sure about the imagery in this – very suspect…“Thus the dusky maiden’s refusal to bow down to masculine domination caused the world to explode into war that lasted eight years, with a hiatus in the middle when one of the knight’s friends got lost in a copse. The End.”So…a sexist morality nonsense tale? Didn’t know what to write for a blog post, eh?“Can you tell?”"

        "\"No disrespect to Jalen, but\".\"I think preparation leading up to this point has been the key thing with our offensive coaches helping us throughout the process\", Tagovailoa said.The win gave Alabama its 17th national championship.There will be many eyes on Alabama and MSU through the spring and into the summer months to see how Saban and Joe Moorhead handle their quarterbacks.President of Saint Louis School, Glen Medeiros, said \"The tradition here at Saint Louis School is one that has us believe that there's nothing that we can't overcome\".The first obviously begins with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.Before even committing to the Crimson Tide, of course Tua wanted to go to OR to follow the path his big bro Mariota set for him.Andy Pappanastos is off the hook.",
        "The ensuing 40-yard attempt sailed wide left, leaving Alabama scoreless.Saban rolled the dice and came up a victor on Monday night and his decision to throw in his freshman Tua Tagovailoa into the mix worked out pretty well. \"He has unbelievable talent, unbelievable release and can get out of trouble as you saw\"'. But, the young sophomore was there for his team every step of the way to give Tagovailoa encouragement.For Hurts, the cooling off period is a good thing.",
        "It's hard to imagine any situation mirroring the night vs. day dynamic of Hurts in the first half Monday and Tagovailoa in the second.It wasn't just Tagovailoa and Smith.The players stormed the field and in one play, Tagovailoa became a hero for life in the state of Alabama. His 80-yard touchdown pass for a 20-7 lead midway through the third quarter seemed like a dagger.Meanwhile, junior wide receiver Calvin Ridley has played in 43 games for Alabama, with 1 fumble that was recovered.",
        "Trailing by three and facing fourth-and-5 from the Dawgs 33 with 42 seconds to go, Sherrill called a timeout to discuss his team's options.Both were against Texas in the 2009 title game, and both were by special teams, including an interception of a ball thrown by punter P.J. Fitzgerald. \"He provided them some juice, got them some momentum, got the momentum swung back their way\".Tennessee will have to fight Alabama tooth and nail to land Tagovailoa.",
        "He drove the Tide into field goal range.One play later, the Tide was national champions.The freshman receiver originally committed to Georgia but de-commited after Mark Richt left the program.\"If you look at the Sugar Bowl, you could kind of see on the sidelines some coaches and players, knowing people in that building, they were pushing for Tua in the Sugar Bowl.",
        "Then we had another shot in overtime and we weren't able to do that\".For one former SEC coach, the move to Tagovailoa came a bit later than if he were still the coach.Subscribe and download our College Gridiron 365 podcast on and."

        "Are animal proteins better than vegetable ones? Let’s clarify this debate that often arises when it comes to defending or attacking the vegetarian and vegan lifestyle.Proteins are polymers made up of the union of several “bricks” called amino acids. Among the three macronutrients, proteins are those whose structural role represents the primary function, while the energetic role is secondary, unlike carbohydrates and lipids.",
        "Proteins perform hundreds of different functions in the body and their intake with the diet must be constant, as the body does not have a real protein reserve, unlike lipids and carbohydrates.When it comes to proteins, two fundamental aspects must be considered: quantity and quality.- Quantity: the body can obtain the amino acids it needs either from the proteins we ingest with food or by degrading the proteins present in the body, such as those that make up muscles (mechanism that explains the reduction of muscle mass during low-calorie diets);- Quality: the body uses twenty different types of amino acids.",
        "Our body is able to synthesize only some of them while others, defined as “essential”, must be introduced exclusively with food.It is therefore important to choose foods not only for the amount of protein they contain but also for their quality, so that it provides all the amino acids needed by the body.Which is the best protein source: animal or vegetable?",
        "Leaving aside the ethical choice, the aspects to be analyzed are many and often cause confusion.- If we only consider the chemical aspect, the amino acids that make up animal and vegetable proteins are identical. The difference lies in the amino acid composition of the proteins.",
        "Those of vegetable origin are penalized by the fact that they do not provide all the essential amino acids, while animal protein sources are complete in their composition and for this reason they are defined as “proteins of high biological value”.- However, we must take into account that by eating any food we also ingest other nutrients. Red meat contains proteins of high biological value but also saturated fats and molecules that increase the risk of developing colon cancer, for example.",
        "If we ingest a plant-based food, we know that we do not bring all the essential amino acids but also fibers, polyphenols, vitamins and minerals that will have a protective effect, for example for colon cancer. So, no food has only positive aspects, but each food must be evaluated in its entirety.- Digestibility of proteins. It is not enough for the food to contain a certain amount of protein if the body is unable to digest them and absorb all the amino acids.",
        "Proteins of animal origin have a very high digestibility while those from cereals and legumes have a digestibility of 80-90% and the other vegetable sources about 50-80% compared to animal ones. This is why the nutritional recommendations indicate a daily protein intake increased by 10% in subjects who take exclusively vegetable proteins.To conclude, the transition to a more ‘vegetable’ dietary model does not necessarily improve the nutritional adequacy of a diet.",
        "The closer you get to a vegetarian model, the more important it is to ensure a high variety of protein sources used. While, if you opt for an omnivorous diet, it is important to carefully choose animal foods in their entirety of nutrients and try to make at least half of the proteins from plant sources."

        "H-EDS/JHS can be a debilitating, disabling and devastating disease for some patients. Some people can have a milder course. It is a spectrum and in my family, we are three people with this disease, but with different manifestations and degrees of severity.Taking care from the moment of diagnosis can change a child’s future. Consult a rheumatologist who understands how serious this condition can be in some individuals.",
        "Your child’s rheumatologist also should know that instead of waiting to see what kind of course it runs in your child, it is better you get the advice and consultation of a good physiotherapist right now as a preemptive and preventive strategy.Personal Example of difficulties a child/ teenager might face:I had excruciating shoulder and back ache as a kid from carrying my school backpack. I had severe pain for days on after attending PE (or PT) classes on Saturdays.",
        "I had severe pain in my fingers and hand when trying to keep up with teachers writing on blackboard or dictating notes. I had severe pain in my legs in the evening making it difficult to do my homework. My school rickshaw did not turn up one day, and I walked 2 km back to home – and the leg pain lasted for days. As I grew up, I cycled 2 kilometers to school – precipitating severe leg pain and asthma everyday. I had recurrent urinary tract infections (including few episodes of cystitis) since I was ten.",
        "I was easily exhausted – fatigue is a problem in many JHS patients. I could not tolerate extreme temperatures, and low blood pressure has always been a problem. As a teenager, I started migraines. I got a subluxation of my jaw joint when I kept my mouth open too wide for too long during a dental procedure. I have recurrent gum problems in spite of good dental care since childhood.",
        "As a teenager, my wrists got severely and irreversibly damaged within a matter of two years after lifting water filled buckets daily. I have very poor proprioception (joint position sense) in my knee joints, and without looking in the mirror I have no idea if I am overextending or not. I consciously keep it microbent (flexed) a bit all the time – which has its own side effects, but it lowers the knee pain. I do forget some times, and it precipitates severe pain.",
        "I have to be mindful about my joints all the time. Small forgetful incidents where a joint is in a bad position or stressed for some time can lead to pain for weeks.Your child might face variations of such symptoms – believe him/her and get proper help. A person with JHS must not do impact sports or high velocity sports. You will need to talk to the teachers as well to ensure they get to do beneficial PE instead of something that leads to pain and damage.",
        "Proper fitting completely flat shoes with good cushioning inside as essential. They can damage their wrists by lifting weights like bags if it is done daily or frequently. Some JHS kids also have sleep and gastrointestinal disturbances. They should stay active to stay strong, maintain stamina and avoid obesity. The child should avoid sitting in W position and doing funny tricks with weird joint contortions.",
        "They may have problems related to coordination, gait and balance that can affect their education and career choices.It will help to consult a tertiary center of physiotherapy in some reputable hospital for your child to get help in these matters:- Gait training for walking and standing without overextending joints (like knees for example). They will need training for core stability, core strengthening and posture.",
        "They have to learn to be conscious of their posture and what is the right posture.- Know the specific exercises that will help them. They will indeed need to stay active and exercise daily.- Learn that they must not go to the full extent of the stretch in any exercise- they need to stop a few cm short of the full range. If they move their limbs to the full range of movement, most likely they will overextend their joints without knowing it.- They must not do the same activity for a long time.",
        "If they are writing, stop after half an hour, do some oral or other studies and then go back to writing.",
        "Same postures (of hands, fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, feet, any part, any joint) for a long duration will go on damaging the ligaments.- When they start using computers, they will need to learn how to use them without damaging their wrists and getting spinal problems.- Swimming is considered beneficial.The rheumatologist should inquire about and coordinate the management of other systemic (other than the musculoskeletal) manifestations the child has – dysautonomia, dyspraxia (coordination difficulties), eye problems, gastrointestinal problems, respiratory or allergy related problems, urinary problems, etc.See these articles/websites to know more about the correct approach to managing kids with joint hypermobility syndrome:Children’s guidelines from BritishSociety for Paediatric and Adolescent RheumatologyChildren with JHS advice sheet (excellent explanation)"

        "Welcome to Church ... Kids Not InvitedMike ThomasI was so distracted once at a church service (away from here), from an overwhelming amount of noise from the audience, that I had a hard time concentrating on the lesson. I tried focusing my attention on the speaker, but the person behind me and a few others across the isle were extremely loud—for what seemed to be every 30 seconds. The problem?",
        "You may think I am referring to rowdy kids or fussy children, with parents who would not take them out, but in fact I am referring to adults. The noise was coming from grown people during an adult Bible class! They had coughing attacks that made it difficult for them to sit quietly.What did I do as a member of the audience? Instead of giving them the “evil eye” or condemning them, I extended patience to them with the hope they would quiet down in a little bit.",
        "And, after a few minutes, their coughing subsided. I may have missed a few comments the speaker was making, until the coughing stopped, but I eventually picked up on the lesson and was able to benefit from the study.I recently learned of a church of Christ that does not permit small children in the auditorium during worship services. If the children want to accompany their parents to services, they must go to a daycare within the building during worship.",
        "While this might sound like a great solution to the “fuss” caused by small children, it reeks of foulness and self-centeredness to me. How can parents rear their children in the “training and admonition of the Lord” while leaving out one of the most essential aspects to godly living: worship? What kind of message does this send to the children regarding church services?",
        "To any honest observer it says, “If you bother me in church, I will have you removed.” There can be no other message sent!How can the adults at that church teach the children about patience and longsuffering if they exclude children from worship for an occasional cry or whimper? I agree that excessively noisy kids should be removed—to a nursery or cry room to meet their needs. But that is a “horse of a different color” than not permitting them in worship services all together.",
        "If such is the case with children, what about adults who make excessive noise, as in coughing or sneezing too much? Are they to be denied entrance for not controlling their irritated throats and noses? To be consistent, such would have to be the case — for a coughing adult is no quieter than a toddler needing a diaper change!If the reasoning behind keeping children out of worship is that it keeps things under control in the assembly, the people need to rethink their reasoning.",
        "They might think they are teaching the children the importance of worship by not permitting them to be in the assembly until they are quiet, but in reality it says the exact opposite. If worship is essential for Christian growth, which it is (I Corinthians 11:30; Hebrews 10:24-25), why are we not permitting them to witness and partake of it with us? How are we training them to worship God when we won’t even show them how to do it?",
        "Would we do the same with other “important” assemblies (funerals, weddings, etc.)? Even the Jews were taught to let their children see them worship so that “when your children say to you, 'What do you mean by this service?'“ they could then explain the need for worshipping God (Exodus 12:26-27).",
        "How can we do any less with a much greater covenant?[If the matter is over “Children’s Church” in place of worship, then such would be just as wicked because godly “men” are to lead in worship (cf., I Timothy 2:8), and not children or women.",
        "Creating a separate assembly for children (or women) just for the sake of letting them have the lead in worship is just another way of resisting God’s will for women and children to be in submission to men.]There must be a balance in the noise that takes place in the assembly. Those who are making the noise should do all they can to control it as soon as possible (I Corinthians 14:33). Those who are not making the noise must show patience and do their best to concentrate on God.",
        "The solution is not to ban small children from worship, else adults with health problems would need to be kicked out as well. Instead, our emphasis should be on the worship and praise of God, which is why we are assembled in the first place (Ephesians 5:19-20). God tells us He is a God who “is greater than our heart, and knows all things” (I John 3:20), so why should I be impatient with someone who needs 5 seconds to get their noise under control?",
        "If God can still hear our prayers, songs and praise, why should I stop offering it to Him because of a crying baby or coughing adult? Is it in keeping with God’s character to be impatient with others? Or is it in keeping with His attitude to be inconsiderate of others when we are making excessive noise? Then why should His worshippers fail to demonstrate such qualities in the most sacred assembly on earth — worship?",
        "How ironic it must be to God for people to gather in His name to worship Him (a selfless and considerate being) yet fail to extend the same attitude toward one another. Can people truly love God without showing such love to others (I John 4:20-21)?"

        "Protecting Repayment of the EB-5 Investment: How to Navigate the Jungle of Intercreditor Loan AgreementsBy Mike GibsonEB-5 loans are often undertaken as subordinate loans. When in a subordinate position, an EB-5 lender should always consider whether it would be beneficial to request an intercreditor agreement from the senior lender in the transaction.",
        "If a lender’s and borrower’s negotiating power permits it, an intercreditor agreement could be a critical component in protecting the lender’s ability to repay EB-5 investors in a distressed project situation.If the parties negotiating power does not support it, an intercreditor agreement can simply further erode a lender’s rights without any real benefits.",
        "Given that an intercreditor agreement can be a double-edged sword, a key early decision in a transaction is whether to require an intercreditor agreement as a lender, if one is not imposed by a senior lender in a transaction.Identifying the Different Types of LoansBefore diving into the details of an intercreditor agreement, its important to understand the difference between a senior loan and a junior, mezzanine and subordinate loans, as these terms are often used interchangeably.A senior loan is a loan secured in the first and highest priority position by collateral of the borrower, in the EB-5 context, the collateral is often real estate.A junior loan is a loan secured by the same collateral as the senior loan but in a second or other junior position.",
        "A mezzanine loan is secured by a pledge of the ownership interests, like membership or partnership interests, of the real estate owner. The borrower is holder of such ownership interests and not the real property owner.A subordinate loan, whether a junior loan or mezzanine loan, is secondary to the rights of the senior lender on a project.",
        "The key rights that could be subordinate are the right to realize on or sell any collateral held by the subordinate lienholder or the right to payment under the subordinate loan.Each definition of the loans may have a nuance or altered meaning based on the specific terms and conditions of a transaction, however, the use of these terms means something to the average person that operates in the financial world and consistent use of these terms can avoid confusion regarding how a transaction is actually structured.",
        "In any of these structures, an intercreditor agreement should be considered by an EB-5 lender.Key Points to Consider in a NegotiationIf you can obtain a reasonable intercreditor agreement, there are certain key points that every EB-5 lender should consider in that negotiation, which mostly relate to preserving control or economic rights over a project as long as possible.",
        "The key points in an intercreditor agreement for a subordinate lender are to preserve the ability to foreclose on collateral for the subordinate loan, preserve the ability to receive debt service payments, obtain the right to take over a defaulted project and complete construction and development, preserve recourse against guarantors and obtain the ability to purchase a senior loan if an event of default occurs.Other key points include the ability to approve modifications of senior debt, in particular adverse changes in economic terms of the senior loan, and to have a standstill on the exercise of senior lender’s remedy of foreclosure for a limited period of time.An additional benefit of being in a subordinate position is that the senior lender often will have the administrative infrastructure to monitor loan draws and the progress of construction of the project, thereby reducing the cost of the loan to the subordinate lender.Even though intercreditor agreements are beneficial, not all key points will be achieved in every negotiation.",
        "There are some items that a subordinate lender might have to give up in an intercreditor agreement.A subordinate lender will often be asked to give up the right to foreclose on subordinate collateral unless timely exercised, the right to repayment of subordinate debt if subordinate lender is unwilling or unable to cure defaults related to the project, the right to make independent decisions in a bankruptcy of the borrower, the right to pursue remedies against guarantors that are common guarantors with senior lender, the right to modify subordinate loan documents and the confirmation that EB-5 funds will be disbursed prior to senior loan funds.So many rights of a subordinate lender are lost and key rights of the subordinate lender must be promptly and properly exercised or a borrower’s default can result in a total loss of an EB-5 investment in a project.When an Agreement may be BeneficialAn intercreditor agreement can often take more than it can give a subordinate lender.",
        "Given that, unless the EB-5 lender or borrower have leverage to obtain a reasonable, arms-length negotiation of an intercreditor agreement, a subordinate lender will often be better suited to close a loan transaction without an intercreditor agreement.",
        "An EB-5 lender will have leverage in a transaction when its funds are critical to completion of a project or the lender has the independent economic means to complete a project.A borrower will have leverage when it has a good, long-standing relationship with a senior lender or the ability to replace a senior lender with another party.",
        "A subordinate lender should consider these factors prior to even requesting an intercreditor agreement and after careful consideration, it could be a rational decision to proceed with a loan without requesting such an agreement.The EB-5 loan has long conjured up an image of a covenant and compliance light loan structure on interest rate terms that are significantly more favorable than could otherwise be found in the marketplace for similar loans. The appeal to borrowers of such loans is understandable.",
        "However, the question was whether the regional center lenders and EB-5 investors were being properly protected in the prevailing EB-5 loan structures and documentation.The evolution of EB-5 loans to more market loan structures and documentation terms is essential to the continued growth and viability of the EB-5 industry. Intercreditor agreements are a key part of that evolution.",
        "EB-5 investors are demanding loans and transactions that are structured on market terms and with market protections for their investment.",
        "Transactions that are structured solely as borrower-friendly vehicles without market protections for the EB-5 lenders and investors, will likely never find the investors needed to utilize EB-5 capital in a project.EB-5 investors should not view intercreditor agreements as a requirement to a solidly structured EB-5 subordinate loan transaction but they absolutely should consider whether such an intercreditor agreement can be obtained on favorable terms in a subordinate loan structure.(Editor’s Note: Chinese translations may vary slightly as published.)Use a Facebook account to add a comment, subject to Facebook's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.",

        "GRAND FORKS, N.D. – After 17-consecutive games without a win, the University of North Dakota women’s soccer team picked up a huge win over in-state rival North Dakota State, 4-2, Wednesday at Bronson Field.The last win for UND came on Sept. 7, 2012 against South Dakota State, 3-1. North Dakota had also been shutout in five of the first-six games to start this season.However, all that came to an end as UND received scoring from four separate players to power past the Bison.",
        "Additionally, three players scored their first collegiate goals.Caitlin Dahl scored in the 11th minute to give North Dakota the early lead. Fellow freshman Zoe Foster dished a pass to Dahl from the right flank toward the top of the 18-yard box.",
        "Dahl took a high shot that curled in off the crossbar and off the goalkeeper’s fingers.Dahl’s goal would stand as the lone mark of the first half, as the second half would feature a flurry of scoring.Within five minutes after the start of the second half, North Dakota extended its lead when freshman Robyn Wujkowski got her head on a loose ball inside the 6-yard box.",
        "NDSU’s goalkeeper Katie McCormick tried corralling the ball after it was played in, but a scramble that ensued between her and her defensemen allowed Wujkowski to get enough on the ball to put in in the back of the net for her first collegiate goal.Unfortunately, UND was unable to keep a clean sheet as NDSU’s Katie Tallas scored off a header in the 62nd minute to cut the lead in half.Just eight minutes later, however, Foster stole the ball in the attacking third and had room to carry it into the right side of the box.",
        "After a few touches, the freshman put the ball in the upper far corner for her second goal of the season, giving UND back its two-goal lead.Three minutes later, Wujkowski and sophomore Marissa Ricci created a two-on-one break after the Bison turned the ball over while pressing through midfield.",
        "Wujkowski passed the ball just outside of the box and Ricci finished the pay, chipping the ball over the goalkeeper for her first collegiate goal.With time running out and North Dakota up 4-1, the Bison continued to attack, eventually finding a second goal with only 19 seconds remaining in the game.",
        "Meghan Johnston put back in a rebound after an initial shot was deflected within the 6-yard box, making the final score 4-2.Kirsten Olsen also had a penalty-kick opportunity after NDSU was called for a handball inside the box. Olsen got the shot on net, but NDSU’s McCormick made the save.UND goalkeeper Kristi Hestdalen recorded five saves in the contest.",
        "North Dakota out-shot the Bison 21-19, with a shots-on-goal margin of 10-8 in UND’s favor.North Dakota returns to the pitch on Sunday, hosting Boise State at 1 p.m."

        "PlayStation 4 Launch Dampened by Dearth of Hot Games11/15/13 2:05 PM PTSony's first new console in seven years, the PlayStation 4, has finally hit the market. It started retailing Friday, but the launch was not without its glitches.Among the reported hardware problems were some complete failures. Less catastrophic, some systems would not output a signal through HDMI.",
        "Shuhei Yoshida, the president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, said the company is looking into those reports.Issues cropped up for staff of game publication IGN after they updated the system with the Day 1 patch, intended to offer additional functionality that was not ready by the time units started shipping.Sony did not respond to our request to comment for this story.Launch FeaturesFollowing the launch, users in North America could take advantage of the Remote Play system, which allows them to play many PS4 games through their PS Vita handheld devices over a WiFi network.The Vita can be used as a second screen experience, as can many smartphones through the PlayStation App.",
        "The system is designed for easy recording and sharing of screen shots and gameplay. It can natively stream gameplay to Ustream and Twitch -- PlayStation Camera owners can also stream camera images and microphone audio in their broadcasts.Up to four users can log into a single system simultaneously. The party chat system lets friends chat independently of the applications and games they are using.",
        "Of course, the PS4 offers multiplayer gaming and Blu-ray and DVD functionality as well.Entertainment AppsThe system offers more than just gaming, with a multitude of entertainment apps such as Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, NHL GameCenter LIVE, and NBA Game Time for consumers to access movies, TV and sports content.The console has digital-only output this time around, with Optical Audio, HDMI and LAN ports, and an auxiliary port for the PlayStation Camera.",
        "The 500-GB hard drive is easy to switch for one with a larger capacity or even a solid-state drive.The power supply is built into the system casing, alongside an eight-core AMD x86-64 bit CPU, 1.84 TFLOPS graphics GPU, and 8GB of GDDR5 RAM, as iFixit reported in its teardown. The front of the until includes two USB 3.0 ports.Ho-Hum ReviewsEarly reviews of the PlayStation 4 are somewhat middling.",
        "The DualShock 4 controller and strong physical build of the system have won praise, but the somewhat messy user interface and the lack of exclusive, must-have games at launch have drawn criticism.Many of the launch titles are multiplatform games, and some are also available on the PlayStation 3.",
        "Since the PS4 is pegged as a gaming system more than a home entertainment center -- especially considering the system does not support external USB storage -- the lack of groundbreaking titles might cause some gamers to hold off on buying a system.\"I think by January, they need to be very clear about what software will be available in the near term,\" Billy Pidgeon, an independent video game analyst, told TechNewsWorld.\"It will be in Sony's best interest to make as much software available early in 2014 as possible,\" he added.\"There's always a dividing line between early adopters and the mass market,\" Ted Pollak, senior game industry analyst at Jon Peddie Research, told TechNewsWorld.",
        "\"In most console launches, the console software has not been optimized yet for the capabilities of the system. Whether we're talking about PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, some consumers may wait until the system has fully optimized titles. However, I think the people that wait for optimization are a minority.\"Delayed GameWatch Dogs was pegged as an important launch period title for the system and is hotly anticipated by many gamers.",
        "But developer Ubisoft delayed the game's release until the spring.\"Having high-quality launch titles is important in any console launch,\" said Pollak. \"However, all it takes is a few high-quality titles to satisfy most customers. ... People that were eagerly anticipating [Watch Dogs] specifically may hold off on purchasing the console.",
        "However, because the title is a new intellectual property and has not proven itself in the marketplace, the strength of that effect could be limited.\"Sales TargetsSony no doubt wants to storm right out of the gate with the PS4 after the PS3 lagged behind Microsoft's Xbox 360 in sales for much of those consoles' histories.",
        "The PS3 hit 80 million sales earlier this month, while the Xbox 360 had shipped more than 80 million units by the end of September.Nintendo's Wii U launched last year, but it has had disappointing sales, so the race for marketplace dominance appears to be between the PS4 and Xbox One.\"Sony, in my market and from what I've observed, started advertising before Xbox in the United States, and they may be rewarded for that in the holiday season,\" Jon Peddie Research's Pollak offered.\"However, Xbox has recently launched their marketing campaign.",
        "They're significant and drawing consumers towards the Xbox also,\" he pointed out.\"Sony did have some wins, I think, that were basically picking up on some negatives from Microsoft, having to do with control,\" Pidgeon said.Microsoft stumbled in its early messaging, though ultimately it backed off, he pointed out. \"There were some issues about whether games could be resold and whether the consumer would lose some value from that, which they feel very strongly about generally.",
        "The consumer wants to have resale value on the software. That gave Sony a bit of advantage, and they played further to that by concentrating on hardcore gamers, which is the early audience on PS4.\"Cheaper ConsoleThe PS4 already has a key advantage over the Xbox One -- it is retailing at US$399, $100 less than its rival, which debuts next week.\"The two systems are in a bit of a race to see which one can develop a larger install base sooner,\" Pidgeon added.",
        "\"The sooner there are 5 million, 10 million units in use out there, that gives third-party publishers the opportunity to have a million-seller [game]. Until you have 5-10 million of a particular console out there, it's very difficult to sell a million units of software.\""

        "MARS in Capricorn is in his exaltation. his {348} quality expressed in the world of action is Theodore Roosevelt. One has only to contemplate his method to understand the full effect of Mars in Capricorn.In the world of science, we have two men of incomparable vigor and persistence, Pasteur and Edison; while, to return once again to political life, we find Edward VII with this position of Mars.",
        "This is a very astonishing case; there is little of high ability to be found in this monarch, but Mars, rising in this sign, gave him the executive force to carry through the Triple Entente, one of the greatest diplomatic achievements in the world's history.Goethe also has this position; in this connection we notice the brusquerie of much of his verse, its leaping, forceful, direct quality.",
        "That any man could win such signal triumph is amazing; the art of poetry seems to demand smoothness rather than this abrupt sledge-hammer method. Rossetti, for example, with the same position, scores only partial success. The rough scansion of much of his verse must be called a flaw, whereas with Goethe it was a virtue.",
        "But Rossetti's Mars is in conjunction with Neptune and in opposition to Saturn, with no buttress to such aspects but a distant trine of the Sun, while Goethe's Mars is trine to Mercury and the Sun.Ruskin and Tolstoi have also this position, but Ruskin's Mars is the storm-centre of a great complex, which considerably modifies the effect, while Tolstoi's is in conjunction with Neptune, increasing its eccentricity and violence by harnessing materialism with mysticism.",
        "A better illustration of the effect of this position is Savonarola. Here we see clearly the sudden fierce resolution and the tenacity of purpose. Afflictions by Saturn and the Moon tended to increase the asperity of the method, and doubtless they contributed to its failure; but the method is indicated clearly enough by the position.Among women we have Cleo de Merode with the Moon trine and the Sun and Venus in square to Mars. From this comes her incomparable power to have her own way in everything.",
        "Incidentally, the planet is on the cusp of her eleventh house, and its main effect is therefore to enable her to influence friends. The trine of the Moon includes the public among such friends, and modifies the fierceness of her method by masking it with a show of yielding grace.",
        "In reality, she was just as full of will and determination as Cromwell.For the benefit of those who are not in possession of Raphael's {349} Ephemeris, or who are not able to interpret the symbols contained therein, the years when Mars is in the sign Capricorn are as follows:From October 20th through November 28th 1841September 17th \" November 1st 1843March 9th \" April 27th 1845February 11th \" March 24th 1847January 19th \" February 27th 1849December 31st 1850 \" February 7th 1851December 10th 1852 \" January 17th 1853November 20th \" December 28th 1854October 29th \" December 6th 1856October 2nd \" November 12th 1858March 23rd \" June 9th 1860June 23rd \" September 29th 1860February 20th \" April 3rd 1862January 28th \" March 8th 1864January 7th \" February 15th 1866December 19th 1867 \" January 26th 1868November 28th 1869 \" January 5th 1870November 7th \" December 15th 1871October 14th \" November 22nd 1873April 20th \" June 15th 1875September 1st \" October 23rd 1875March 2nd \" April 16th 1877February 5th \" March 18th 1879January 14th \" February 22nd 1881December 26th 1882 \" February 2nd 1883December 6th 1884 \" January 12th 1885November 15th \" December 23rd 1886October 23rd \" December 1st 1888September 24th \" November 5th 1890March 14th \" May 6th 1882February 14th \" March 27th 1894January 23rd \" March 2nd 1896January 2nd \" February 10th 1898December 14th 1899 \" January 21st 1900 {350}From November 24th 1901 through January 1st 1902November 3rd \" December 11th 1903October 8th \" November 17th 1905April 2nd \" October 13th 1907February 24th \" April 9th 1909February 1st \" March 13th 1911January 11th \" February 18th 1913December 22nd 1914 \" January 29th 1915December 2nd 1916 \" January 9th 1917November 11th \" December 19th 1918October 19th \" November 27th 1920September 14th \" October 30th 1922March 7th \" April 24th 1924February 9th \" March 22nd 1926January 19th \" February 27th 1928December 29th \" December 31st 1929"

        "!Part of this is cross posted from here...I was flying on the shores of Lake Huron in Michigan today; absolutely gorgeous weather and flying conditions.How do scenarios like this affect the barometer? Once the copter takes off, does the barometer \"see\" this altitude change? Would lidar be a good addition to have in order to get a true altitude reading once launching from the cliffs? Today was a practice flight for a trip this summer to PIctured Rocks on Lake Superior in da U.P.",
        "where I want to get some nice video of from above the water. I find it difficult to judge how far above the water the copter is and wonder if the barometer provides an accurate altitude so my equipment doesn't end up in the drink.Air pressure will not be different above (at your take off point) or beyond the cliff.",
        "Thus your barometer should read the same value and should not register any altitude difference once you go over the cliff and expose your copter to 20m altitude.Air pressure value changes from the mean sea level. Where you flew your copter was the same vertical distance from this sea level.GPS vertical data cannot be trusted at this situation either.",
        "So the only way to register the altitude difference in your case would be using some type of distance sensor (ultrasonic, IR etc.)Thanks, I'm looking into LidarLite.I still don't understand how there can be such drastic altitude errors when using RTL/Land (by switch or Auto mission) in only a few minutes of flying.",
        "It happens at my home, field and yesterday at the lake and two different copters, one using Pixhawk, the other AUAV-X2.Today I had a small crash with 3.3 RC3+: Before landing accidently I switched to drift mode. After landing I want to disam via yaw stick but the copter flipped on the ground. I think it should be possible to disarm the copter in every flight mode.",
        "I know thats stupid to land in drift mode, but when done disarming should be possible.Cheers GregorI also happened with 3.3 rc1.Looking forward to RC4 Best guess on when it will be available?Randy is going to be trying for Sunday.To all the developers,will the \"follow me\" mode be smarter on the succeeding builds? I would love to see it perform better in follow me mode, like filming you from behind, or from your side. I think as of now, it is limited to fly above you.just sharing my opinion.",
        ":) thanks again!We are continuing to improve the performance of the follow me controllers. As Randy says, the rest is done from the ground station."

        "INSIDE THE STEPHENSON HOUSE - July 23, 2003Hi! Henry the Stephenson House mouse is back again. Letme tell you, Ben's Birthday Party was great! There were lots of peoplehere enjoying ice cream and cake as they wished Col. Ben a happy birthday.Mary, her committee and a lot of the FBSH Board members had \"my\"house in tip-top shape. They had the windows sparkling clean and yes,you are right, it was George who mopped the floors.",
        "The living room wasa step back to the 1820's with the antique furniture and antique accessorieson the mantel and tables. The breeze wafting through the open windowscompleted a beautiful picture of Col. Ben and Lucy entertaining in the1820's.Henry saw lots of you folks at the party, including Bob, Henry and Shirley;Esther, David and Mary Deane; Corrine, Betty Jean and Jean. Hey, we hadtwo Colonels' at the party: Col. Ben and Eleanor and Colonel Charles werehere!",
        "I watched as you all were enjoying the ice cream and that superdelicious cake of Dottie's. I watched and listened as you talked withthe folks dressed in 1820's clothing! I counted seventeen of Col. Ben'svisiting friends and relatives in their beautiful, authentic clothingand they were enjoying the day! Wasn't Elle cute as Elvira the Stephenson'syoung daughter?You can see that the FBSH Board loves to give parties! This one was ratherspecial in that contributions could be made to a fund for Col.",
        "Ben's newstaircase. Well, once again you all were very generous and contributedover $1600. The people of Edwardsville have a wonderful sense of historyand a tremendous community spirit. Col. Ben loves it and so does Henry!The researchers received another nice surprise. It was a letter writtenby Col. Ben to Daniel P.Cook on April 22, 1815. It was written as Benwas on his way back to Kaskaskia from his first session in Congress.",
        "Benwrote from Summerset: \" I arrived here this evening with my family,the road is extremely bad, in four days more I expect to reach Pittsburgh,when I intend to take water to Furguson's ferry.\" In the letter Col.Ben asked Cook to rent him a home at Kaskaskia, writing \"Get anyhouse that you think will answer, we won't be particular for the present.\"He also told Cook that he needed a place for a hatter's shop.",
        "A youngman was with Ben and he wanted him to \"go to business immediately.\"Ben also had the equipment with him that would be needed for the hatter'sSo, it appears that Lucy and family did make the trip to Washington withCol. Ben. The researchers have never been too sure if she went with Col.Ben or not. Then just the other day good old Cousin Jake came up withsome recollections!",
        "Jake recollects that Great-great-great grandfatherSamuel used to tell how excited Lucy got when she found out she couldvisit her relatives and enjoy seeing her children meeting their aunts,uncles and cousins. The Swearingen and Stephenson relatives lived in Martinsburgand Shepherdstown, Virginia, and both towns were almost right on the wayto Washington.",
        "It seems just logical that she did not go to Washingtonbut took this opportunity to visit her family.It is doubtful, though, that Lucy would have stayed in Washington withCol. Ben in 1815. The stories Ol' Henry heard about the streets, the livingconditions and the social life in Washington plus the condition of theroads just to get to Washington at that time were scary! Most membersof congress did not bring their wives and families until around 1850.Sure sounds to Henry that Col.",
        "Ben brought his family home to Kaskaskiaafter they visited relatives in Virginia. Congress had recessed for almosta month before they headed back to Kaskaskia. It seems like the Stephenson'sspent some time in Virginia before they began their trip home to Illinois.I have an idea that the researchers will tie all this together and theywill also find out where Summerset and Ferguson's Ferry were located.As I said the birthday party was sure great and Henry even got some cakecrumbs!",
        "Then I really got lucky when I jumped in the car to go home withCassie. As I told Cousin Jake, I ate like a king for a couple days andno one knew I was there! I got back home when Cassie's mother stoppedby Col. Ben's house and I just jumped out of the car! Col. Ben and Henryboth had a great couple days!Right now I am waiting for the columns for the porch to arrive - theywill be awesome! Folks, Henry is sincerely glad you took time for anotherlook at Col. Ben's house.",
        "I keep telling you, do not miss this restorationas it progresses!! When the upstairs area is ready for a group, you mustcome see the upstairs rooms and see how the beams and wood were used forthe roof. You know, in the near future all this wonderful old brick andthe interior roofing will be hidden from view forever with plaster.The big weekend and my secret visit to Cassie's have worn me out and Iam going to go enjoy a long, long nap.See ya' later,Henry"

        "Intuition is more than just a characteristic of highly sensitive people. For us, it is a cornerstone of our existence. It is the way we interpret life, how we learn, how we can become visionaries and how we pick up on the unspoken. In my experience, intuition can go so far as to being able to sense the type of off-screen relationship two actors have simply by watching their on-screen performances together, as well as being able to pick up on aspects of their off-screen personalities.",
        "Intuition can decipher what or who is behind the masks that are often used to conceal a piece of reality that doesn't want to be revealed.Intuition isn't based on logical fact gathering, making it difficult to trust. A feeling that instantly makes itself known by permeating the soul, shrouded in an ambiguous cloud of realization, can be amazing and uncomfortable to handle.",
        "It’s amazing in the sense that you simply know things, almost instantly, without knowing how or why; uncomfortable in the sense that you're not sure you should trust just a feeling that seems to come from within.There were many times when I second guessed that gut feeling, especially when it came to life decisions, other individuals' characters, motivations and intentions.",
        "After all, we're taught that the most important decisions in life should be based on facts, figures, what appears to be true, what will benefit us the most financially, and what seems to be the most logical. For sensitives, though, I think this approach can be an elusive trap that ignores our ability to sense, rather than dissect the answer.The answer that logic leads you to can be diametrically opposed with the one that intuition gives us.",
        "I'm certainly not advocating that either approach should be abandoned in favor of the other, however, it’s been my experience that if your intuition is telling you \"no\" when logic is saying \"full speed ahead,\" you should stop and listen.",
        "Sometimes when you don't listen to intuition's \"no,\" it has a funny way of magnifying that \"no\" the entire time you're living with the manifestation of that decision.Intuition instantly permeates through the masks that people use in an attempt to conceal their authentic selves, perceptions, motivations and intentions. It also sees through the politics that are played, which can make those that have perfected the illusion of a political persona very uncomfortable around you.",
        "The ability to sense what and who's beneath the surface helps you discover what people are unwilling to disclose openly. Intuition senses the soul, that inner essence full of past history, present existence and future aspirations. It is invaluable in discerning who can be trusted, how someone really feels about you, what that person wants, as well as the potential the relationship holds.The ability to tune into the information that collective consciousness can bring us is also a part of intuition.",
        "Some call it the voice within, but I believe that those sudden whispers of premonition and insight come from the spiritual realm. Psychic ability is a heightened form of intuition that we all have the potential to develop and tune into. The difference for highly sensitives is that this potential comes already built in.",
        "It is automatic, as natural as breathing when its intended use is to help others, or prepare ourselves for events we otherwise wouldn't be able to handle properly without forewarning.We don't want to think that a feeling, a sense of what is, can be as accurate as an analytical trail of puzzle pieces forming themselves into a conclusion. There's no explanation for \"just knowing\" or a method of how you arrived at the answer.",
        "Many things in this universe are inexplicable, but one can't deny the awe of their existence. When we begin to trust and believe in what doesn't seem to make sense, what can't be physically touched, we realize that reality begins with the invisible.It's what goes on behind the scenes that brings the show to life. Why should you deny its validity?Really awesome and insightful article. One of my favorites actually. I completely agree, and you bring up a lot of good points.",
        "I definitely can relate a lot of my own experiences to this.Thanks! Glad you enjoy it. It's kind of scary how lucid this post is since it was only one month after my concussion. As for the rest of this blog....well, we'll see.As a HSP, at times i've always felt that when feelings of a persons character that came out of nowhere were always false. i say this because i always thought that i was overreacting.",
        "because i would literally be living my life and then all of a sudden i get a feeling behind someones words or actions. My question to you is, is this my intuition or is it my HSP acting up and reading too far into it. and my other question would be, as HSP's how do we know when we are reading in too much on a certain subject or person? If you could email me at Motor-Spirit89@hotmail.com that would be great. any advice or tips would be GREATLY appreciated.",

        "In the course of the exciting work being done on Main Street, U.S.A., at Disneyland park, a piece of Disneyland history was opened up yet again.Fans of the Main Street Arcade are familiar with its Welte Orchestrion – the large self-playing pipe organ that has entertained guests for decades.",
        "While the arcade is closed as part of the current Main Street, U.S.A., refurbishments, the Disneyland Electromechanical team is taking the opportunity to perform maintenance on this impressive instrument – which is older than the park itself. But you might be surprised at what is found inside …Since 1945 – thirty years after the instrument was first built – those working to repair and restore the Orchestrion have signed their names to an interior panel, and the tradition has continued to this day.",
        "Dave Allan, an electromechanical technician at the Disneyland Arcade Shop (which cares for all of the resort’s electromechanical devices – from coin-operated machinery and popcorn carts to park turnstiles and FASTPASS machines) first came to work at Disneyland more than 35 years ago to work on the Orchestrion.",
        "He first signed is name to the instrument in 1974, as you can see in the photo above.I visited Dave and his colleagues Ken Knibb, Joel Viado and Jeff Garcia late last year at the Disneyland Arcade Shop for the rare opportunity to see this giant machine being cared for by these talented technicians. Though it has been through maintenance before, those times have been surprisingly rare.“It probably won’t be opened again for another 30 years,” Ken told me.",
        "The instrument still has it original acoustics and pipes, but the team is working to restore it to as close as possible to original condition while still being able to be enjoyed by guests daily upon its return to the Main Street Arcade. When it does return, it will feature more of the original music that it was first designed to play.Be sure to check out the Welte Orchestrion when it returns in its full glory to the Main Street Arcade later this spring.",
        "And I’ll be back soon with an update on this amazing piece of Disneyland history when Dave, Ken and the Disneyland Electromechanical team are all finished with it – for the next 30 years, at least.12 CommentsJanet on March 19th, 2012 at 7:14 pmHow nice was this! Thank you for sharing this story.",
        "What a talented group you have in maintenance.Cynthia from CA on March 19th, 2012 at 7:26 pmI love this pipe organ…I plop in a quarter every time I visit the park and play the Mickey Mouse March…everyone recognizes it and stops to listen and watch…thanks for your great work in keeping it so well preserved!",
        "Can’t wait to see all the work finished on Main Street!THERESA on March 19th, 2012 at 7:49 pmDo you have a date when the orchestrion will be up and running again?Trent from ON on March 19th, 2012 at 8:28 pmGreat story! I’ve always been fascinated by these automated music machines at the Disney parks. Many have faded away over the years but it’s great to see that some remain and that they are in good hands.",
        "The Walt Disney Company bought a collection of dozens of automated music machines from Paul Eakin in the 1970s. Much of the collection was sold in 1997 but many pieces remain in Disney Parks around the world.Penny on March 19th, 2012 at 8:36 pmI used to work for a company that builds pipe organs. Signing the inside, either as a builder or repairer is an industry tradition that I’m glad to see upheld at Disneyland (a place of great tradition).",
        "Pipe organ construction tends to be intended for very long term use. I know the company I worked for planned for a 150-200 year life span for their products.What an interesting article, thanks for posting it!Jim on March 19th, 2012 at 10:01 pmI wish the arcade would make a return.",
        "It was one of my favorite things to see on main street at a kid.Fred from CA on March 19th, 2012 at 10:06 pmVery cool!I love that pipe organ!Debora on March 21st, 2012 at 12:32 amI love learning about the small treasures and the talented and creative teams behind them. The love and passion that goes into disney is amazing. Thank youKrista on March 21st, 2012 at 12:43 amI love this post!",
        "Thanks for sharing it!Mikey on March 21st, 2012 at 3:33 pmTHANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!I am so glad Disney is taking an interest in these machines again like when Walt Disney was originally in charge, it’s a real shame that the new owner today wasn’t in charge about 14 years ago. That was when most of these instruments were sold, including band organs, orchestrions, nickelodeons, dance organs, and music boxes too.",
        "There was (pre 1998) a Wurlitzer Pian Orchestra in the arcade, but that was sold too. This instrument was actually restored in 1998 and sounded GREAT! Until a new midi selector was put in which was not made for the instrument. trust me, this instrument will sound MIND BLOWING when the restoration is done!",
        "Just take the tip that the tune selector is not made for the instrument!Mikey on March 21st, 2012 at 3:36 pmAlso, the instrument isn’t in that bad of shape, so it shouldn’t be too hard.Christine from CA on March 24th, 2012 at 1:28 pmI can’t wait for this to come back!. I wish the once behind Dumbo still played.12 Comments"

        "After falling behind 2-0 in the first they were able to score 3 goals in the second and held onto the lead until the last minute of regulation.- Atlanta outshot the Caps 39-25 in regulation and 43-30 overall.",
        "Johnson was named the third star of the game for his performance despite the loss.- The Caps killed off 6 of 7 power play chances by Atlanta, including a 2-man advantage lasting a little over a minute early in the third period- Despite the offensive firepower on the bench, the Caps once again were blanked in the shootout.- This game marked the second time Atlanta goalie Kari Lehtonen gave up three goals in one period over the course of a week; he also gave up a three spot to Carolina in a 4-3 loss on October 13.Things to Watch For:- Richard Zednik is known as a streaky scorer whose points come in bunches; his 2-goal performance Monday night could signal the start of an offensive outburst by the recently returned Capital.- Hanlon shuffled the lines before the last game and seemed to get good results, so it wouldn't be surprising to see the same combos out there again tonight.- Atlanta has lost two straight and four of their last five after a quick start to the season.",
        "The goaltending will be the biggest question heading into tonight's game - star netminder Lehtonen has given up 17 goals in his last 4 games and was pulled for the first time in the 5-2 loss to Carolina Wednesday night. According to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, backup Johann Hedberg will man the pipes tonight.- The Caps have gotten stellar goaltending performances almost every game from their duo in net, and I would expect nothing less tonight.",
        "The one thing to watch for is the shot total - the Caps continue to allow 30+ shots every night and may not always be able to rely on goaltending alone.- In the last three games, the Caps have allowed only 2 power play goals on 21 chances. The problem? 21 chances in 3 games...still not great.",
        "They were 4 for 4 on Monday night, so that's a good sign.- Ovechkin had 2 assists against Calgary but neither Alex has scored in the last 140+ minutes - this after starting the season with 14 of the Caps' 31 goals overall.",
        "I'm not too concerned though...if there's one thing those two can do, it's score.- Only 4 players on the Caps roster have yet to register a point, and all four have been scratched from the lineup at least twice.- Dainius Zubrus leads the team in penalty minutes with 22 - that's a penalty a game, and yet he's still been one of the most consistent performers so far. Go figure.- I haven't mentioned it yet because I was waiting for details, but it appears that Rrrrico Fata is no longer with us. *Sniff*.",
        "After clearing waivers, Fata chose to pursue opportunities in Europe rather than report to Hershey, and I wish him all the best.Projected Lineup for the CapsForwards:8-Ovechkin, 9-Zubrus, 17-Clark28-Semin, 24-Beech, 18-Pettinger21-Laich, 16-Sutherby, 10-Bradley87-Brashear, 15-Gordon, 20-Zednik2-Pothier, 26-Morrisonn6-Heward, 27-Clymer47-Muir, 52-Green1-Johnson, 37-KolzigForwards:17-Kovalchuk, 20-Rucchin, 14-Sim13-Kozlov, 39-Kapanen, 18-Hossa23-Slater, 16-Holik, 19-Mellanby29-Larsen, 9-Metropolit, 11-Vigier2-Exelby, 25-Sutton3-Vishnevski, 7-de Vries5-McCarthy, 34-Hnidy1-Hedberg, 32-Lehtonen"

        "I'd recommend it to just about anyone! Very lightweight, thin and not at all bulky, I love the non-adjustable leg loops. This may be my perfect harness.I also work in a gym, so I'm often belaying for long periods of time, and I've ended up wearing this harness for 6+ hours just because it was so comfortable that I didn't feel like taking it off!Sizing is an issue- Familiarity: I've put it through the wringerI have been using the R280 from 2008 forever and love love love it.",
        "Not sure when the sizing changed but there are 2 major problems that would easily be fixed. 1. New models do not have a waist strap that is long enough. I have narrow hips, this would be so much worse if they were normal or large. I have the small and I can barely squeeze my hips through the harness (often I just unbuckle it). I cinch it down as tight as it goes, so a medium would be too big in the waist although it would be easier getting over my hips.",
        "The issue here is having to unbuckle the strap, not a great thing as when rebuckling if a mistake is made it could be fatal. Please, please make this strap longer! Yes it might flap around but that is insignificant to fitting well. The R280 has 4 \" longer. 2. The leg straps are not long enough. I am somewhat long waisted, so perhaps this does not affect alot of women. The leg loops ride up to my crotch which is incredibly uncomfortable after about 10 minutes belaying.",
        "A 2 week trip climbing daily left me with bruises around my crotch. Another 2-3\" of extension on the leg loops would allow this to fit almost any body type.",
        "Cross posting in hopes of getting the engineers' attention, I do not want to switch to another harness--these are the absolute best when they fit right :)Best Harness- Familiarity: I've put it through the wringerI climb in this harness for 24 hours straight and I never noticed it once!Step Up Your Harness Game- Familiarity: I've used it once or twice and have initial impressionsFit: Arcteryx fits small.",
        "I wear a small in Black diamond harnesses, and originally tried a small in another Arcteryx harness, and was bummed to find that it fit a bit tight around the thighs and almost too small around the waste. I probably could have made it work, but my thighs were a bit too muscular for comfort in the small. Got a medium and fits much better, although may be a bit larger around the waste. Chronic problem.",
        "For comparison, I wear a size 8 in arcteryx pants, but a 6 in most other brands.Performance/Use: This harness is awesome – the material and fit make it super nice to climb in, the gear loops are more heavy duty than my previous BD harness.",
        "I only use it for sport/lead climbing, but have been pleased with performance.Lightweight yet super burly- Familiarity: I've put it through the wringerI've used a previous generation of this Arc'teryx harness for 5+ years and it's held up wonderfully - I've completely put it through the wringer and it's still in fantastic condition with no obvious wear and tear. I love that it's super light and doesn't feel like you're wearing a harness at all, yet it's comfy on long hanging belays.",
        "Great for hot days and long approaches, and doesn't start hurting if you're working a move and falling over and over.I use this for cragging, alpine climbing and canyoneering. I can fit two thin layers under the leg loops (wool long undies and hiking pants) if needed. I have a different harness for ice climbing and mountaineering when I need thicker layers and/or the ability to put my harness on while wearing crampons.",
        "I love that it stuffs so small and takes up almost no space in my pack.I'm expecting to get a lot more mileage out of this harness, and when it's finally time to move on, I will definitely come back and buy another one.The most comfortable harness ever- Familiarity: I've used it several timesI also love how low profile this harness is. It compacts down super small, which is great for getting to remote crags and bike to climb endeavors.Yay!",
        "photo shoot!Am I even wearing a harness?- Familiarity: I've used it several timesSo light and comfortable! that is what makes or breaks a harness! After having an Arcteryx harness I'm not sure I can go back to my other harness! Arcteryx's webbing design is truly the way to go. In the gym or on the big wall you cannot go wrong with the FL 355! Most people are skeptical about the non adjustable leg loops but they are not as bad an you would think.",
        "I actually preffer it because the buckles don't get in the way or get caught on anything. I love the minimalist weight of the harness Also the protected gear loops are nice too so you don't have to worry about the loop wearing as quickly as a fabric loop does."

        "We cannot always stop our lives every time we are confronted with Arab terror. Arab terror is our daily reality.If selected for publication, it will appear as soon as possible on Haaretz.com.A barrage of rockets was fired into Israel yesterday evening, apparently in response to the targeted killing of an Islamic Jihad operative in Rafah earlier in the day.",
        "Yet despite the renewed rocket attacks, the Israel Defense Forces said an escalation in the south is unlikely.Late last night, a rocket was shot down by the Iron Dome system near Be'er Sheva, while another one fell on or near a home on Kibbutz Yad Mordechai, lightly wounding a child.Seven rockets fired earlier in the evening fell in open areas and caused no injuries or damage.In a joint Israel Air Force-Shin Bet security service operation, Ismail Al-Asmar, 34, was blown up in his car very early yesterday morning.",
        "Two other people with him were lightly wounded.IDF sources say that Asmar transferred funds to the Popular Resistance Committees activists and the Egyptian terrorists who carried out the terror attack near Eilat last Thursday and who were planning another attack from the Sinai peninsula.Islamic Jihad fired two mortars into Israel yesterday morning, in an immediate response to the assassination.",
        "There were no injuries.Following the mortars, the Home Front Command instructed residents near the Gaza border to stay close to protected areas and ordered mass events canceled in the south.In the middle of the afternoon, however, the command decided to reduce the alert level. During a meeting between Home Front Command commander Maj. Gen.",
        "Eyal Eisenberg and Ashkelon Mayor Benny Vaknin, it was agreed to allow the four-day Briza Music Festival in the city, scheduled to open last night, to take place.But as evening approached, the defense establishment got warning that Islamic Jihad was planning rocket launches; the alert level was raised again and yesterday's performances were canceled.",
        "A new security assessment will determine the fate of today's scheduled performances.Other events canceled yesterday included the Jerusalem Festival, scheduled to take place in Netivot; and two soccer games, one between Betar Jerusalem and Hapoel Be'er Sheva, meant to take place in Be'er Sheva, and one between Ashdod F.C. and Ironi Ramat Hasharon, scheduled to take place in Ashdod.Between 7 and 9 P.M., seven rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel.",
        "Five fell in areas belonging to the Eshkol Regional Council, one fell near Ofakim, and the seventh fell south of Ashkelon.",
        "The Popular Front claimed responsibility for the Ofakim rocket.The air force responded by attacking the Islamic Jihad cell that launched the rockets from Gaza City, killing one terrorist and wounding several others.Hamas leader Mahmoud Al-Zahar, meanwhile, termed the terror attack last Thursday near Eilat \"strange,\" saying Israel had exploited the attack to retaliate in the Gaza Strip.He noted that no group had taken responsibility for the attack.",
        "Israel, however, insists that the Popular Resistance Committees were responsible for it.Although rocket firings resumed yesterday after two days of relative quiet, the defense establishment believes there will be no major escalation in the coming weeks, as Hamas has a clear interest in maintaining its self-declared cease-fire.Also yesterday, a woman was wounded when a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip fell into the Egyptian area of Rafah."

Everything was ready to go so I got to feast my eyes on the different stations:Appetizer StationThe appetizer station was filled with things like Caesar Salad, Cheeses, Breads, Olives, Pickles, Asparagus, Shrimp, Herb-Roasted Chicken, Pasta Salad, Beef Carpaccio, and more.",
        "It was hard to limit myself because I love carbs but I also had to save room for the entrées and desserts.Mushroom RavioliSpeaking of entrées, they're all served hot so I couldn't get a group shot of them all, but this Mushroom Ravioli blew my mind. I try to temper my expectations for any buffet since variety usually trumps quality, but at 6pm, these ravioli were al dente, full of mushroom filling, and demanding of a second helping.Mahi MahiAnother entrée that spoke to me was the Mahi Mahi.",
        "Coated in a tangy sauce, these were satisfyingly flaky but not dry. Seeing distinct pieces of it served was also a treat as I'm used to seeing sloppy filets at buffets.Pasta StationAt the Pasta Station, the Pasta Man was all smiles as he stir-fried some farfalle (bowtie pasta) for me. I opted for the full works (a variety of scallop, shrimp, sausage, tomato, peas, and carrots) with my pasta.",
        "The pasta is all pre-cooked, so it's not as magical as made-to-order, but this is a buffet after all, so I think pre-cooked pasta is an acceptable compromise. During our 2 minutes of mild social intimacy, the Pasta Man revealed to me that on Sundays he's the Omelette Man.Farfalle AlfredoDessert StationIt's common to believe that a dessert station is what makes a buffet great because if the pastries aren't tasty, the whole experience can be ruined.",
        "Variety was the spice of life at this station with more choices than any other station at the Italian Opera Buffet. There were a ton of parfaits, cakes (including a pistachio one!), tarts, and puddings to choose from. I personally enjoyed the creme brulee seen below and could have eaten 6 of them if I wasn't busy trying all the other desserts.Creme Brulee and Strawberry Mousse CakeFeatures:The Italian Opera performances are the main reason one visits Oceans 999 on a Saturday.",

For those with stashes of Italian performance DVDs or playlists on Youtube, this is the real thing. No mics. No acoustic booster. It's all voice. It's all breath control. These folks covered the classics all night so my mom was very familiar with the songs.",

Plates were promptly taken away by the staff and a manager even asked how our meal was going.",
        "At one point we spotted a dirty glass (perhaps an old dishwasher in the kitchen?) but as soon as we alerted a staff, they came back within a minute with a fresh clean glass. It was actually pretty busy here this Saturday -- evidently some people love the idea of opera and buffet! I feel this is a pretty unique experience worth checking out if you have someone who would a casual evening of live opera.",
        "They take reservations on OpenTable and I'd recommend coming right at 6pm so you can get the freshest food and the whole operatic experience.Note: The buffet is the main feature here but you can also order à la carte from the dinner menu if you don't want the buffet experience.Final Thoughts:One-liner: A unique experience that combines a better-than-average buffet with legitimate live operatic performancesHighlight: The freedom of dining and listening to live operaPrice per person: $57 (sans drinks, taxes, or gratuity)Would I go back?",

        "Using this alternative fuel reduces the petroleum the vehicles consume by 62% and the greenhouse gas emissions they produce by 65%, compared to the previously-used oil-based fuels.“If racing Corvettes and Ferraris are performing well on E85, then you better believe it’s good for consumers [with flexible-fuel vehicles] to use in their cars,” Atherton said at Rolex 24.At the end of this year’s season, teams in the TUDOR Championship that go the farthest and the fastest with the smallest environmental footprint will win the Green Racing Challenge award.",
        "These teams will serve as a model for sustainable transportation and prove that energy efficient vehicle technologies are capable of high performance in extreme racing conditions.Green Racing is one of many Energy Department efforts to make motorsports more sustainable. The Energy Department and NASCAR recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding to find ways to further incorporate transformative clean energy technologies into NASCAR operations.For more on Green Racing, visit greenracingcup.org."

        "Courage under fire. Farah Naqvi writes.india Updated: Sep 19, 2011 21:51 IST.It’s inevitable that justice for the weak will be a political hard sell. And laws around the world seeking to secure justice and equality for the weak have been forged through fires of hot contestation.",
        "The first Civil Rights Act of 1957 in the US was greeted by howls of protest from White chauvinists.Even ‘liberal’ John F Kennedy chose political realism over principle and voted against it in Congress for he knew it had little popular support at the time.",
        "JFK became a ‘civil rights champion’ later; some say only when he sensed greater need for the Black vote.Closer home, the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989, was preceded by a robust Dalit rights movement, and high profile cases of Dalit atrocities set the stage for its passage.But the backlash soon followed and attempts continue till today to stymie its implementation.",
        "The Draft Prevention of Communal and Targeted Violence Bill, 2011, (PCTV) faces similar challenges.These laws are different from the spate of legislative and policy measures in recent years ensuring basic entitlements.",
        "Take the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) and the Right to Education (RTE) — one promised employment to the rural poor, the other elementary education.These are unexceptionable wares to peddle in the political marketplace of populist ideas, lending themselves easily to sound byte debates in TV studios, apparently the new testing ground for ‘popular will’.The arguments that NREGA and RTE faced weren’t social or political, but economic (with neo-liberals asking: ‘Will there be too much burden on the exchequer?’ Or ‘Why do the poor deserve such generous hand-outs?’).But special protection legislations, within a civil rights framework, seeking to install systems of justice for the weak are different.",
        "They demand that we as a nation acknowledge inequality and discrimination as a fact of our society, polity and criminal justice system.",
        "They demand the naming of particular classes of citizens as weak and others as strong.They demand from our political class a will to embrace principles of equal, secular citizenship over the politics of populism.The PCTV bill is anti-secular, it should be burnt, it should be put in a trashcan — these are are some of the unnecessarily strident remarks we’ve heard in recent TV debates.Curiously, the government’s discredited Communal Violence Bill of 2005 didn’t elicit such shrill abandonment of civilised discourse because the 2005 bill didn’t challenge the biased use of State power that allows communal violence to spread.In fact, it augmented and further concentrated powers in the hands of the State (Modi would have embraced such a bill).The 2011 PCTV Bill, by comparison, attracts vicious protest partly because it does threaten the communal violence machinery, by making the State accountable for discriminatory use of its powers.Evidence of this does not need to be excavated from the recesses of distant history — because State bias in cases of identity-based attacks is not a thing of the past, as critics claim.",
        "Look at the fate of Dalits and Muslims in recent weeks and months — in Madurai (September 2011), Moradabad (August 2011) or Bharatpur (September 2011); look at Tamils in Karnataka (March 2008) or Biharis in Mumbai (October 2008).",
        "They are why we need this bill.There may be much in the draft PCTV Bill, 2011 that its critics can improve, but its core (robust State accountability) represents the hope of securing equal protection of laws for all citizens; of giving meaning to the idea of sadbhavna.Political momentum follows from acts of political courage and for true sadbhavna we need that courage from our political class.(Farah Naqvi is a member of the National Advisory Council. The views expressed by the author are personal)"

        "So Arias is now facing a retrial for the penalty phase of her trial, and a new jury will be selected to decide what her sentence will be.The new penalty phase of the Arias trial is scheduled to begin July 18.",
        "Judge Sherry Stephens also scheduled a status hearing on June 20 to check in with the attorneys about their preparations for the new phase of the trial.At the June 20 hearing, either side could ask for more time to prepare their case for the retrial, and it will be up to the judge to decide if the attorneys should be given more time to prepare.Another possible delay could occur if Stephens releases defense attorneys Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott from the case.HLN legal experts say this is unlikely to happen, because Stephens has already denied the defense team's multiple requests to quit the case.If for some reason Stephens does allow Nurmi and Willmott off the case, new attorneys may need more time to prepare for the retrial of the penalty phase, since they'll have to get caught up on the case and the previous phases of the trial, too.",
        "This could potentially push the start date of the retrial later than July 18.If new defense attorneys are not given an adequate amount of time to prepare for the case, it could help Arias' appeal of ineffective counsel in regards to her sentence.However, Stephens, who may want to avoid another delay, might not let Arias’ current attorneys, Nurmi and Willmott, off the hook., Arizona, right now.Join the conversation..."

        "While SF EXPO China may reach more international exhibitors and visitors via MFN's access to nearly 70 countries, MFN will be able to present itself better in the Chinese market by using classroom and booth space at the exhibition.

        "The petition was filed by social activist Karamat Ali who was presented in the court.Mr Karamat’s lawyer, Faisal Siddiqui argued that electricity supply for an entire area should not suffer due to non payment of bills from one person.",
        "He continued, saying that electricity theft should not be remedied by cutting power supply to everyone in a given area and instead the thief should pay the price.During the hearing, officials of K-Electric were also present.80% of Karachi in The DarkThe Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCP) had ordered K-Electric back in 2014 to avoid loadshedding during the holy month of Ramzan, according to Mr. Faisal.",

        "BATON ROUGE, La. -- For the first time since the disappointing loss to Clemson in the Chick-fil-A Bowl, LSU will be in action for public consumption Saturday when the Tigers play their annual spring game at Tiger Stadium.Like many teams in college football, most of the Tigers' preparations are done behind closed doors. For the public, there is no access to practices. For the media, there are a mere 10-15 minutes of open practices most days. For students, there's Thursday's open practice (4 p.m.",
        "with student ID).That makes Saturday's game a rare public viewing for most LSU observers. With the curtain raised, here's what we look forward to seeing the most:1. Cameron's offense: We know most of the players in LSU's offense. Zach Mettenberger, Jeremy Hill, Odell Beckham, Jarvis Landry -- you can go down the list of familiar names.The big question is how they will be used in new offensive coordinator Cam Cameron's offense. Will the Tigers still be a power-run team, as they've been in recent seasons?",
        "Will Cameron spread the field with a lot of four-wide sets? Will running backs and tight ends be split wide? Will they throw it in the red zone or try to power it?Certainly, we don't expect to have Cameron's LSU offensive playbook figured out based on the spring game, but it will be interesting to see what is valued most in the new offense.2.",
        "Young ends ready?: Two of LSU's returning defensive ends have played sparingly, but figure to get a lot of spring game snaps given a numbers crunch LSU is temporarily experiencing at the position. Jordan Allen is a player we had been hearing has been on the cusp of earning more significant playing time before a knee injury ended his 2012 season.",
        "Danielle Hunter played on special teams a lot last year and looked like a future star.They both were caught up in a numbers game behind a talented group of ends, including three players will will likely be taken in next week's NFL draft. Are they ready to replace that production?We won't get to see Jermauria Rasco in action, however. A likely starter at one of the end positions, his spring ended with a shoulder injury.3.",
        "Kicking it around: With a new offensive coordinator and so many new faces on defense, the battle for the place kicker spot has garnered little attention. But it's a key spot, considering LSU's consistency at the position over the years and the Tigers' emphasis on gaining an edge on opponents on special teams.James Hairston, who handled kickoff chores last year, is battling walk-on Colby Delahoussaye for the field goal spot.",
        "Can they provide the Tigers with the same consistency they received from Drew Alleman the last couple of years?4. La'el at left tackle: La'el Collins came out of high school with a reputation as being arguably the nation's best tackle prospect.Now a junior, we'll finally get to see him play tackle in a game. After starting at left guard last season, the spring game will be our first chance to see him start at left tackle for LSU.5. Man in the middle: D.J.",
        "Welter has been the surprise starter at middle linebacker throughout spring. Most expected the junior, who missed all of last season for academic reasons, to fall behind members of the talented 2012 linebacker recruiting class in the depth chart.So far, Welter has been the guy with Lamin Barrow, who many expected to move to the middle to replace the departed Kevin Minter, staying on the weak side, where he excelled last season.",
        "Is this going to be the 2013 lineup or will Barrow eventually slide to the middle to make room for one of the talented sophomores, such as Kwon Alexander?"

        "“She has a will to continue to the next level, and she didn’t want the season to end.”It was a matter of staying after it, said Blankenship.“We just kept saying, ‘Don’t give up,’ ” she said. “This was our game, and we deserved to be here. This is our house, and we protected it. We played well when it counted.”With the score tied at 58-58, Unicoi in-bounded the ball 94 feet from the basket with 15 seconds remaining.",
        "Hannah Rice raced down the court, and went to the hoop for a layup attempt. But Kalee Johnson blocked it and recovered the rebound.It was the fourth blocked shot of the game for Johnson, who also had 12 points and 12 rebounds.“We had her back there in center field, and she did a good job of stepping over aggressively,” said Abel.",
        "“She did a great job executing.”When Johnson got the rebound, she looked up and found Blankenship behind the defense.“As soon as she had the rebound, I knew to go,” said Blankenship. “I knew she would have her head up down the floor. She’s always good at looking ahead.”Blankenship caught the home-run pass in stride, and beat a charging defender to the basket.",
        "She got the layup to crawl over the rim and into the hoop as she was fouled.“I was nervous about it going in,” said Blankenship.Unicoi once again went to Rice, and she beat the defense to the frontcourt — only to have Kaitlynn Kincer make the defensive gem by poking the ball away from behind as Rice was setting to shoot a 3-pointer.“We wanted to keep the ball in front of us, but Rice did a good job getting around us,” said Abel.",
        "“It was an excellent effort from Kincer to get back and get the tip. It was another senior stepping up and making a big play.”Unicoi took early control of the game with seven straight points to close the first quarter with a 20-13 lead.",
        "A late 8-0 run by the Lady Warriors in the second quarter gave them a 31-29 halftime edge.The Lady Blue Devils edged back out to leads of 43-38 and 47-41, but Blankenship and Jamie Lee Clark each nailed a three ball in the final 26 seconds to make it 49-47 at the end of three quarters.Unicoi maintained its lead throughout the fourth quarter, and was ahead 58-55 with a chance to open a two-possession lead from the free throw line with 31.4 left.",
        "A miss gave Happy Valley another chance, and Annie Woods’ tough rebound in the lane was followed by a kick out to Blankenship, who rained a 3-parade to tie the game with 15 seconds remaining.Chelsey Harness had an impressive effort in the losing cause, totaling 16 points and 11 rebounds.

        "Paul said in 1 Corinthians 9 19-23 “To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win Jews” and “to those who are outside that law, like one outside the law“. Some say that he was setting a new precedent in terms of what foods he would eat so that he could be reach Gentiles. Is there another way that this passage can be understood?[This article is based on exegesis of this passage by Dr.",
        "Mark Kinzer, adjunct professor of Jewish Studies at Fuller Theological Seminary.]In 1 Corinthians 9, Paul writes; outside that law, like one outside the law—not being outside God’s law but within the law of Messiah—to win those outsideThis passage has traditionally been understood to be Paul’s missionary principle of accommodation that would justify him living as a practicing Jew amongst Jews and as a non-practicing Jew amongst Gentiles.What naturally follows from this understanding would be that Paul would have viewed himself as sometimes exempt from observance to the Law of Moses.",
        "Is that actually what the passage is saying, or is there another way to view it?Under, Outside, or Within the LawThis passage describes three groups of people; those “under the Law”, those “outside the Law” (sometimes translated “without” the Law) and those “within the Law of Messiah” (or “within the Law of Christ” in some translations).Much hinges on the understanding of the expression “under the Law” and refers to the relationship a Jew would have legitimately before the death and resurrection of Jesus.",
        "It is compared elsewhere to a child who has not yet reached the age of maturity (Gal. 4:1-2) as contrasted with full adult “sonship”. From verse 21 in Galatians 4, it seems Paul is addressing Gentile believers in Galatia who wanted to be “under the law” because they falsely thought it provided something that they lacked though faith alone in Jesus.In the passage in 1 Corinthians 9, the contrast is made between being “under the Law” with being “outside the Law”.",
        "The first refers to the status of Jews apart from the death and resurrection of Jesus and the second refers to Gentiles who apart from faith in Jesus and His death and resurrection are entirely outside the framework of any divine covenant.“Under the Law” is negative only in relations to the far greater status offered through Messiah’s death and resurrection, being “outside the Law” is entirely negative.",
        "Both of these terms are contrast with a third term “within the Law of Messiah” which refers to the new relationship to the Law established for both Jews and Gentiles through faith in Jesus.Unbelieving Jews “under the Law” might be seen to have enjoyed a relatively positive status compared to those “outside the Law” (unsaved Gentiles) however once both Jew and Gentile receive Jesus as Messiah and the fullness His death and resurrection afford us, we are brought together “within the Law of Messiah” and called to a life of partnership.",
        "This partnership does not eliminate all distinctions between Jews and Gentiles; the two are fully equal yet distinct.",
        "It is both Jew and Gentile being “within the Law of Messiah” that entirely changes the previous relationship that existed between Jews (who were “under the Law”) and unsaved Gentiles (who were “without the Law”).So in the passage above, Paul is saying that when relating to non-believing Jews he lives as though he were “under the Law” – though he is in fact not “under the Law” but “within the Law”.",
        "He treats these ‘brethren according to the flesh’ as his genuine covenant family rather than relating to them from a position of superiority and separation. In seeking to win them to faith and the life “within the Torah of Messiah” he was willing to adopt a level of halakhic observance that would be expected within a strictly Jewish environment that would be inappropriate in the Jewish-Gentile setting “within the Law of Messiah”.",
        "So for example, Paul might participate in hand-washing in accordance with Pharisaical understanding of how it should be done; becoming as a Jew “under the Law” to those “under the Law” but not to act in such a way with the Jews “under the Law” so as to cause them to view Gentile Christians “within the Law of Messiah” as being in anyway inferior.Likewise, Paul says that to those “outside the Law” [Gentiles that had not yet come to faith in Jesus] that he identifies with them even though his is not “outside the Law” but “within the Law of Messiah”.Paul, who now eats and travels and works with Gentile Christians (those “within the Law of Messiah”) in the task of reaching those “outside the Law” [unbelieving Gentiles] and Paul demonstrates that he has the capacity to understand and empathize with them where they are at."

        "ANCHORAGE - A report issued Friday provides a wide-ranging look at Alaska Natives, including how the state's indigenous people are doing in areas of population, health, economics and education.The report is an analysis of the Status of Alaska Natives Report 2004, which was prepared by the University of Alaska Anchorage's Institute of Social and Economic Research.The report and analysis were requested by the Alaska Federation of Natives to bring new data to, and generate fresh ideas in, the Native community - and to increase dialogue with non-Natives.\"It is the first report that was done by Alaska Natives studying Alaska Natives,\" said Janie Leask, chairwoman of the board of trustees for the First Alaskans Institute.",
        "\"Applying Native thinking to Alaskan issues strengthens all of us in the end with a more unified, common vision.\"The Alaska Native Policy Center analyzed the data for the First Alaskans Institute, a nonprofit group helping Alaska Natives.Web linksFor more, go toThe report not only provides a snapshot of the status of Alaska Natives but also looks at trends over the past 15 years.",
        "The analysis concludes at least four areas need work simultaneously: improving public education, addressing health issues, creating jobs, and lowering the cost of living in rural Alaska.Even in areas where there continue to be deficiencies, there also have been gains, said Greta Goto, director of the Alaska Native Policy Center.",
        "For example, there are more high schools but the dropout rate is troublesome, she said.\"I think it is a challenge we have to overcome,\" Goto said.The report says since 1974, 155 new high schools have been built in Alaska, mainly in villages. And while 71 percent of Alaska Natives have high school diplomas now, up from 48 percent in 1980, the dropout rate almost doubled from 1998-2001.The data show an increased migration of women and young people from rural villages to urban areas.",
        "The report says 58 percent of Alaska Natives still live in rural areas and 42 percent are in urban areas.\"More and more of our men are being left behind,\" said Carrie Brown, senior vice president of First Alaskans Institute.If economic opportunities were increased and the cost of rural living reduced - especially energy costs - it would be possible for more Alaska Natives to stay in their villages and stop the \"brain drain,\" Brown said.The report says 33 percent of unemployed Alaskans are Natives.",
        "Per capita income is $9,113 for Natives, compared with $18,819 for non-Natives.The report found that significant gains have been made in health care. For example, 81 percent of Native children are getting immunized - a higher rate than in the rest of the United States.",
        "The life expectancy of Alaska Natives also increased from 46.4 years in 1950 to 69.5 years in 1997.However, the data show that obesity among Natives is increasing, as well as teen birth rates, tobacco smoking and use of marijuana.The report says the Native population stands at 119,241, or about 19 percent of Alaskans.",
        "If the population continues to grow at the current rate, there will be an estimated 140,000 Alaska Natives in 2010 and 165,000 in 2020.With the median age a relatively young 24, it is important to consider what to do now to provide for a better future, Goto said.\"These resulting choices will impact how our future is shaped as a people and as a state,\" she said."

        "Mental Health Front & Centre (Canberra Doctor - September 2017)Mental Health Front and CentreAMA (ACT) President, Prof Steve Robson and ACT Chair of the Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, A/Prof Jeff Looi, have met with Mental Health Minister, Shane Rattenbury, to lay out their shared concerns about the state of the psychiatry workforce and other mental health issues in the ACT.The meeting was both cordial and constructive, with the Minister listening carefully to the issues raised and demonstrating a willingness to engage.",
        "While mental health is a new portfolio brought into existence after the last ACT election at the initiative of the ACT Greens, several other Australian jurisdictions have established specific mental health portfolio responsibilities.Psychiatric WorkforceThe major issue raised with the Minister was both the immediate and medium term future of the psychiatric workforce in the ACT.AMA (ACT) believes there are ongoing and serious difficulties in the ACT’s public sector psychiatric workforce.",
        "The situation is currently being held together by the use of locums and the considerable goodwill and dedication of local consultants and psychiatric trainees, together with mental health service management.Away from the immediate crisis, the use of ‘Area of Need’ appointments and locums continues to be the primary means of dealing with the shorter and medium term issues in public sector psychiatric staff recruitment – a situation AMA (ACT) would like to see rectified.The private sector workforce, while not in a similar short-term crisis, is still deficient in consultant psychiatrists and particularly so when it comes to the child and adolescent subspecialty.",
        "As discussed with the Minister, the lack of local private sector workforce is puzzling given the many attractive features working in Canberra provides to medical practitioners.Workforce Plan NeededWhile there seems to be little alternative to the public sector’s use of Area of Need appointments and locums in the short term, AMA (ACT) believes it should be an urgent priority to draft a comprehensive workforce plan for the combined ACT public and private sector psychiatric workforce, both specialist and trainee.",
        "The workforce plan should emphasise recruitment and retention and specifically consider safety, working conditions and incentives to work and remain in the ACT.It would make sense, given similar work previously undertaken by the RANZCP for the Victorian Government, if the College was involved in the ACT workforce plan, at least in relation to the public sector workforce.Mental Health Advisory CouncilAMA (ACT) and the RANZCP both expressed concern over the lack of either a psychiatrist or GP on the Council.",
        "The Minister responded by stating that he recognized the need for suitable input to the Council from medical practitioners.Further discussions with the Minister are to be held in order to determine how it is – whether through co-opting or other means – input from medical practitioners can be made available to the Council.Office of Mental HealthThe Minister has recently released a ‘conversation starter’ that seeks the views of stakeholders on the role and function of the new Office of Mental Health.",
        "The ‘conversation starter’ is designed to seek the views of stakeholders on the role and function of the new Officer of Mental Health.All in all, a constructive meeting with Minister Rattenbury. Now the hard work starts."

        "Tanden, Holtz-Eakin: Health care ruling won't be the endBy: Jennifer HaberkornJune 20, 2012 11:29 PM ESTIf there’s one thing that opponents and supporters of President Barack Obama’s health care law can agree on, it’s that not even the Supreme Court will put to rest the law’s deep-seated controversy.And that could fire up voters between now and Election Day.A ruling against the health law would energize Democratic voters in the 2012 election, says one prominent backer.",
        "And a ruling in favor of it — even if that means at least one Republican-appointed justice upholds it — won’t make its critics suddenly find it politically palatable, said one of the law’s leading foes.“If the Supreme Court actually overturns the Affordable Care Act, I think that will get Democrats overall pretty engaged in trying to determine who the next justices are in the Supreme Court,” said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, who previously worked on health reform in the Obama administration.“[It] will make the Supreme Court a much more political issue coming on top of Citizens United v.",
        "Federal Election Commission, Bush v.",
        "Gore, and now the Affordable Care Act where the Supreme Court is really grasping arguments that have been considered way out of the mainstream in just the last few years,” Tanden said in an interview for the POLITICO video series “SCOTUS & Health Care: The Final Countdown.”But a ruling upholding the law isn’t going to persuade its opponents to back down, either, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, said in a separate interview for the video series.",
        "Republicans already have made clear they see it as a defining theme of the fall campaign.“The law didn’t take on the rising costs, that [is..] its fundamental flaw, and many of its features are simply not going to be politically palatable,” said Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.Holtz-Eakin said the law’s Independent Payment Advisory Board for Medicare is unpopular among Republicans and many Democrats.",
        "He doesn’t like how the exchanges and subsidies are designed and expects that approach would lead to fewer employers offering health coverage.“The policy has to change and the political debate will go on,” he predicted.If the Supreme Court strikes the entire law this month, attention will turn to Capitol Hill, where Republicans have said they would “replace” the law with smaller incremental bills.",
        "And that’s just fine with Holtz-Eakin.“[If] you go back to 2009 at the beginning of this debate, there was a consensus among conservatives, liberals, progressives — whatever label you wanted to attach— that we had problems in access to insurance, but more importantly at the rising cost of health care,” Holtz-Eakin said. “The real flaw with this law is it did not address the health care cost problem. Republicans will be very serious about taking that on.”.© 2015 POLITICO LLC"

        "Vladyka Hilarion: The Russian Orthodox ChurchCan Leave the World Council of ChurchesThe hierarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, led by their newly-elected First Hierarch, Metropolitan Hilarion of Eastern America and New York, took part for the first time in the Council of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church, which met last week. During one of the intervals between sessions, Metropolitan Hilarion gave an exclusive interview to RIA News.",
        "Andrei Zolotov spoke with him.—Vladyka, in your report here on the first day of the Council you emphasized that it was your first time here, and that, therefore, much was new and incomprehensible to you. Nearly three days of the Council have passed. What are your impressions and feelings now?—Firstly, this is a joy because we, the hierarchs from abroad, are sharing such fellowship with our brethren. Of course, we are not acquainted with many of them.",
        "But I think that many of the Russian hierarchs also do not know one another, because of the fact that many have been consecrated only relatively recently. This is a joy because we are working together and are able to learn more about the life and administration of the Church here, of those problems that exist here, and those problems that are common to the whole Church.",
        "The feelings that arise when we make the acquaintance of hierarchs and converse with them, when we discover such brotherly love and understanding, move us to compunction. We see that these men, whom we did not know except from one remove, learning of them from photographs or one news item or another, are quite remarkable. And now we share a fraternal fellowship.",
        "This is an edifying process.—You said in your report that you are not removing from the agenda the question of the withdrawal of the Russian Orthodox Church from the World Council of Churches. Were there any deliberations regarding this, either in the working groups or in the anterooms of the cathedral?—There has still been no official discussion. But many hierarchs have approached and expressed their agreement with this; they were gratified that this question was brought up.",
        "And really, the people of God are everywhere awaiting this. It would ease our position considerably abroad, where many—clergy and laity—have gone into schism because of this very question.",
        "If membership in the World Council of Churches is reconsidered—perhaps we could have observers there as does the Roman Catholic Church—this would probably have a positive affect upon the attitude of many people who feel that past participation in the World Council of Churches and other similar cases of ecumenical interaction have passed the bounds of what is permissible.",
        "If this could be corrected, it would be a great joy for the whole Church.We must not fear that our witness to Orthodoxy will be in any way diminished. On the contrary, when people see that the Orthodox Faith is confessed in our people's life, it will attract them. That our Church changes nothing, that it continues the apostolic, patristic teaching and all the Traditions of the Church—this is precisely what attracts people in the West away from Protestantism and Catholicism.",
        "They see that the Church does not alter its doctrine or its practice depending on modern trends; rather, everything that was set forth by the Savior and the apostles is maintained in Orthodoxy. It is because of this that people come to Orthodoxy. And this will continue in even greater measure, because in contemporary Protestant churches, and in Catholicism itself, the falling-away has been great.—Speaking of the growth of Orthodoxy, the question of missionary activity has also been raised at the Council.",
        "You have your own experience of mission amid the non-Russian-speaking, heterodox milieu. What, in your view, is important for mission in the modern world?—Firstly, what is needed is internal mission. We need to return our Russian people to Orthodoxy—those who have yet to receive Holy Baptism, who still have not come to faith. This is an immense task. And our objective in the West is similar, because we must first work with our own flock.",
        "With our youth, when there are mixed marriages among them, for example. In that case it can happen that they gradually drift away from the Church. Perhaps the husband or the wife will convert to Orthodoxy, but often this does not have a lasting, positive affect. Assimilation is also a great problem. For this reason, we are working with our youth, to strengthen them in the Church. But we also bear witness to those outside.",
        "We are always ready to receive them if they have a sincere intention to come to Orthodoxy. We prepare them, we lead them through the process of catechesis, and then we receive them—either through Holy Baptism, or sometimes through Chrismation.It is not our practice, as it is among certain religious groups, to go from door to door, etc. No. People learn about Orthodoxy from literature, from their friends, through family contacts, through religious publications.",
        "People come by various routes.—Even before your election as First Hierarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia you traveled to Latin America, trying to bring back those who had gone into schism. What today is the situation of those who went into schism from the Russian Church Outside of Russia after the reunification with the Moscow Patriarchate.—In Latin America there has as yet been no progress.",
        "There are not many clergy there; only several priests in a few countries, such as Brazil, Argentina and Chile, for example, have left. I spoke with them all. They told me why they felt compelled to leave. Of course, they were isolated. Their bishop died several years ago, and we were unable to find a replacement for him immediately.",
        "Now there is a bishop [a new bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia was consecrated for Latin America literally on the eve of the Council of Bishops—RIA News], but prior to this there was no archpastoral oversight in situ. And they felt that the questions they raised received no response. I think that this happened because they were ill informed.",
        "And perhaps their isolation tended to preserve old concepts, understandings of the past, when the hierarchs here in Russia were objects of mistrust. Perhaps because they had no opportunity to visit Russia and see the change that had taken place here, that the Church is entirely free. But the question of ecumenism is disturbing to many. In Australia also, those who departed pointed precisely to the fact that the Moscow Patriarchate belongs to the World Council of Churches.",
        "This is the main reason why they left.—Vladyka, experience here in Russia shows that the same people who have protested membership in the World Council of Churches are the ones who are pushing for the canonization of Ivan the Terrible, etc.—Of course there are extremes. But I am speaking about ordinary parishioners who are troubled by this. There are people who will never be satisfied and will always seek reasons for this. But they do not constitute a significant part of the faithful..\""

They were the keynote speakers for the Third Annual Pennsylvania Diversity and Leadership Conference & Exposition.",

Their unique perspectives on diversity were transcended by the common thread of great respect for the human dignity of all. They also shared the stage for being recognized as trailblazers in some aspect of their lives.",

Topics included leadership, mentoring, recruiting and retaining the best talent, talent management, and several aspects of diversity management generally.Many corporations and organizations came to exhibit what they had to offer in terms of diversity services and products. Nearly 30 exhibitors benefited from the hundreds of participants attending the conference.",

        "We are delighted to share with you the full report of that meeting.Strategically planned to coincide with the first-ever African Regional Forum on Business and Human Rights, the meeting was a milestone for the ACCA and laid the foundation for the coalition to be sustainable and locally-led.",
        "Key goals achieved were:- Defining what the ACCA stands for in a vision, mission and strategy statement that participants generated and agreed to;- Defining the coalition’s governance structure;- Electing seven civil society organizations to serve on the coalition’s regionally and linguistically balanced steering committee;- Agreeing on the contours of a visionary action plan.The meeting was convened by Global Rights, and made possible through the generous support of Australian Aid, an anonymous donor, American Jewish World Service, the Fund for Global Human Rights and Oxfam Novib.",

This opening montage featured a still photo of each cast member in the middle of the screen against a background of lights that looked like sped-up traffic. Kenan was the first one announced. Then there was a short opening sketch, which was barely an opening sketch. Alec Baldwin, the night’s host, was in the opening.",
        "At the end of the opening, nobody said, “Live from New York…” – it instead cut to the montage. Kenan was again the first cast member announced. After the montage, Amy Poehler introduced Maroon 5, who then performed. Amy remained on the main stage during the performance. It turned out that Amy was romantically involved with Adam Levine. This didn’t make sense to me, because, last I heard, she was still married to Will Arnett.",
        "I was wondering why Maroon 5 were performing, since Radiohead were the musical guest. Then I saw some indication that Amy wasn’t actually involved with Adam Levine and that she was still married to Will Arnett. But, ultimately it wasn’t clear either way.Advertisements"

        "The two-month anniversary of the movement’s beginning–with marches planned on Wall Street and across New York City–got an inadvertent boost from the Zuccotti Park eviction.Early this morning, at least a thousand protesters assembled in Zuccotti Park, the lower Manhattan space that served as their base camp from September 17 until the NYPD evicted them.",

A small group of protesters grabbed the barricades and dragged them from the park’s perimeter, causing cheers of, “Whose park? Our park!” One of the protesters tossed a barricade in exuberance, which caused police to move in.",

I picked two out I thought she's like and asked my husband which one he thought would be best. He said, \"Elmo.\" That wasn't one of the options. :) But he was right. She would really like an Elmo cake. Elmo's World is her favorite part of Sesame Street.I cooked a 8\" round cake, and let it cool over night.",
        "The next morning I took a long serrated knife (I used my long bread knife) and cut off the rounded top and made it flat. Next I put it in the freezer for about 45 minutes. This helps firm up the cake for the shaping process.Then I used a serrated knife (this time I used a steak knife) to cut around the shape to make the basic outline. I cut some of the jags of the fur, but found as I was frosting it this wasn't necessary.",
        "The frosting helped make the appearance of fur, so I could have just cut the bottom outline rounded, not jagged.Next I took the paper off by sliding it over the toothpicks and leaving them in place. I then used my knife to score the outline of his features. They weren't all visible, but it helped.I then made my buttercream frosting and but a several spoonfuls in a separate bowl. I thinned this portion out a little more with milk for a base frosting.A word on base frosting.",
        "I'd never used a base frosting before, but decided to give it a try. The idea is you put a thin layer of frosting on before the decorating layer. It is supposed to help hold in the crumbs so they do not show through your decorated layer. I wasn't sure if it worked until I tried doing my decorating frosting on some of the edges that I missed with base frosting. It DEFINITELY made a huge difference. The areas I missed with the base frosting were crumbling and falling apart.",
        "Also, my little cake book has a separate recipe for base frosting, but I didn't want to make two kinds of frosting so I just thinned out some of my buttercream and it worked okay. {Call me lazy.}Let the base frosting dry for 20 or more minutes. During this time I started to make some of my colored frosting.",
        "For the each color I put the amount I would need (guesstimated) in a separate bowl to mix it.For orange I used liquid food coloring: one part red, three parts yellow.For black I bought a tube of decorating black. I cheated. :)For red I bought some red food coloring paste. I've tried the liquid and gels before and they just create a dark pink no matter how much I put in. With the paste I was actually able to get a nice red. It did take quite a bit though.",
        "It helped that I was only doing a small amount rather than the whole batch of frosting.Because I only put a thin layer of base frosting on I was able to still see a lot of my scored outlines of his features. The rest I was able to fill in by looking at the picture.First I frosted the orange nose, then the white eyes. When doing this parts I started by putting the majority of the frosting in the center of the area and carefully spreading it to the edges.I used my black tube to do the pupils.",
        "I only made the outline and it came out thick enough that I was able to carefully spread the line inward to fill in the circle.Next I made the outline of the mouth, but I suggest NOT DOING THIS YET! I wish I would have frosted the whole area below the nose and eyes red and then frost the mouth on top of it. The way I did it I kept getting black frosting smeared in my red.When spreading the red frosting, make sure it's a little thicker. This allows you to put it on textured so that it looks like fur.",
        "It's nice that you don't have to worry about putting it on smooth in this instance.I filled in the mouth similar to how I filled in the pupils. I made extra lines with the black tube inside of the mouth outline then carefully spread them around to fill it in.My 2 year old nephew would love this, I will have to give it a whirl soon.

        "Tirtha Maharaja explains how the Vrajavasis entered the yajna (sacrifice) at Kuruksetra during the solar eclipse on the occasion of the original Ratha-yatra in Krsna-lila, recounting the sweet explanation found in Orissan texts.",
        "In this article, originally a lecture delivered at the Calcutta branch of Sri Chaitanya Gaudiya Math, the day before Janmastami in the year 2000, Maharaj discusses the inner meaning of Krishna's divine pastimes during both Ratha-yatra festival and Janmastami.Vamsi das Babaji: \"Weep for Krishna!\":In 1859, in the Village of Majitpur in East Bengal, Vamsi das Babaji appeared in this world.

        "We devotees in the west have been fortunate enough to have the association of Srila Bhakti Ballabh Tirtha Maharaj in the summer months for the past several years, and many of us have had the special boon to spend this auspicious tithi in his presence.

        "Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl Will Be Found In A Theater Near YouGone Girl by Gillian Flynn immediately got our attention in June. This creepy psychological mystery won the June 2012 RT Seal of Excellence. We couldn’t get enough of this read, and we weren’t the only ones. This deeply disturbing tale shot up the bestseller lists and has already been getting some serious award buzz.",
        "So it is no surprise to hear that Gone Girl has just been scooped up for a film adaptation.The story unfolds around married couple Amy and Nick. They’ve recently relocated from New York City to the middle of the country in a move that Amy is none too happy about.",
        "But when, on the day of the couple’s fifth anniversary, the young wife goes missing — is it a simple kidnapping or something much more foul?20th Century Fox reportedly spent seven figures to acquire the rights to turn Flynn’s mystery into a movie. That kind of serious money behind this adaptation can only mean one thing — a fast track to theaters.",
        "And readers worried that the big screen version won't live up to the book can breathe a deep sigh of relief because the author has already signed on to write the screenplay herself. Another notable name attached to the adaptation is actress and producer Reese Witherspoon.",
        "(However, there’s no word yet on if she plans to star as the mysterious missing Amy.)With its cast of not-quite likable characters that kept us guessing right up to the very end, we had a very fun time creating our dream cast.Protagonist Nick who may be a killer? RT staffers easily agreed that although Bradley Cooper may have to die his hair darker to truly become Nick, he’s already got Nick’s signature frat guy good looks.",
        "Plus he may be evil or he may be a grieving husband, but either way he will look darn good as the prime suspect.We’d love to see Gillian Jacobs play the part of Amy. This Community star could easily transform herself into the rich, pampered daughter of two psychologists-turned-childrens’ book authors.",
        "We think that she could step into the awkward shoes of the real life inspiration for her parents fiction success with considerable aplomb — and walk the line between unknowable and supremely likable all at once. (Although that’s of course if Witherspoon doesn’t decide to step up to the role.)Finally, for the role of Nick’s beloved twin sister, Go — who happens to hate Amy with a passion — we’d call in Carey Mulligan.",
        "The actress lacks the Betty Boop, kewpie doll quality that Go (aka Margo) is described as having. However, Mulligan certainly calls to mind old screen star elegance. Furthermore, Go may be the only person readers like, so it’s important that she be played by someone we automatically gravitate toward.Now, we can’t cast anyone else without drastically spoilerizing, but we promise to let you know as soon as more news about this project is released.",

        "My daughter and her friends: Are they laughing at you?**Nota beneToday, 5 months after starting the process, I got the call that JC, the main man of neurology at my hospital, signed my Tysabri order. Which, apparently, means that tomorrow the infusion center will call me to schedule the first infusion. I have to get it scheduled before August 31, or else go back and do another series of MRIs of the brain and spine.",
        "I'd definitely prefer not to, since the stuff they put into the IV (I can't remember the name of it) makes me go loco. Seriously. I have a weird reaction to it. Gadolinium, I think it is.I'm trying not to be whiney and complainy about my medical procedures. I don't do a very good job, though. My last MRI - a couple of months ago, turned out to be disturbing. They measure MS in terms of degrees of 'brain damage'. Basically, three categories - small, medium and large.",
        "Those aren't the actual words, but you get the drift. When I went to have the films reviewed, she said I was at the 'medium' level, which was new, and showed me a section on my corpus callosum which was also new. She showed me these lesions that looked like fingers - like a big, white, hand forming around that part of the brain.",
        "She said \"this is a classic set of MS lesions\", and that that particular area is where you'd see cognitive functionality being affected (one of my particular losses).Later, when I went in to work, I was telling some friends about the big, white hand and we started referring to it as the \"White People in My Brain\". I've got white people in my brain!!!",
        "\"Um, the white people in my brain are stopping me from understanding this Venn diagram...'Another reason I dropped out of western medicine was because of things like this. Is it really helpful to know this? I really don't know. I wonder if, when it comes to damaging lesions in the brain, that ignorance might be bliss.",
        "I figure, you are going to experience whatever the damage is regardless of whether you saw it ahead of time.The Tysabri news felt a bit bittersweet, because fellow MS'er Courtney had a bad reaction to her 2nd infusion yesterday, which was pretty heartbreaking for her. They say if you have an allergy, or sensitivity to it, it will most likely show on the 2nd one. Given the fear about PML, I've read they don't allow you to continue with the infusions after that. But that could be changing.",
        "There are been no new PML deaths since it went back on the market 14 months ago. Like me, Courtney seems to be a side effect magnet with the MS drugs. If we take it, they will come.So, yesterday, I had the big mammo grammo. I don't know how long it has been since I had one. (My friend Paul said \"let's see, when did St. Elmo's Fire come out?\" Which just made me laugh like crazy.)I had my reasons. The last time I had one, they sent me in for surgery to have a tumor removed. Benign, as it turned out.",
        "It was a very unpleasant procedure that I felt I shouldn't have had to do to begin with. I should have had the balls to ask them to do a needle biopsy first, but at that time I wasn't aggressive enough to do that. I tend to get intimidated by the white coats and lose my sense of self. Now, when I have an important appointment that might require decisions, I bring my friend Scotti. Scotti is awesome - she survived metastasized malignant melanoma, and she's a great procedure buddy.",
        "She was by my side during my period of really awful miscarriages, one of which was an emergency room surgical thing with massive blood loss. But I dropped out of western medicine world for a while there because, I think, I was tired of the drama.I think it was about 14 years ago. So I was due. I'll pass on all the details of the mammo grammo (which Adam Sandler character says things like that? Opera man? Or the Louisiana guy?",
        "I started saying it because it made me laugh and thus feel less anxious.) Though I will say, the technician told me I looked like I was scared to death. Which I was. It was my first one since my 'enhancements' and I just could not imagine how this was going to happen.It actually went remarkably well. Much less pain than the last time.",
        "It's funny - I have no reason to think that there are any other tumors or anything, but until they send me the \"prognosis negative\" letter, there's that period of waiting that tends to get on my nerves. Much like the Tysabri. I realized today, when I got the call, that I had had this undercurrent of \"waiting anxiety\" happening for several months.I am just not that good with the waiting thing.",
        "However, in the last year of diagnosing Adrian's dyslexia, finding the right school for him, living through Dagny's 7th grade, having my job change, and trying to get the Tysabri thing in place, I have done a lot of it. And here I am, with many of those things resolved or at least having 'resolution potential'. I have taken most of these things quite literally one step at a time. I would often not know what the next step would be until I finished the current step.",
        "It's been a good lesson in that tortoise-and-the-hare kind of stuff.Next up: 3rd grade, 8th grade, life on Tysabri? Here I come.I've gotta get some sleep - I think the white people are moving furniture around up there."

        "When thinking of the composition of his roster, Rangers coach Alain Vigneault reiterated throughout training camp that “money will be a factor.”In the hard-salary-cap world of the NHL, is has to be, especially for a big-market team like the Rangers with big-money contracts already on the books.",
        "But now that the preseason schedule has concluded and the next game is the regular-season opener Thursday night at the Garden against the Islanders, the Rangers are hoping to obtain something they so rarely have had in the recent past: roster flexibility.The current group of 24 players on the books does include forward Oscar Lindberg, still on injured reserve. It leaves the Rangers with just over $2 million in space under the $73 million salary-cap ceiling.",
        "The amount of money they are under the cap each day accrues, so a penny saved today is one that can be used tomorrow — or at the Feb. 28 trade deadline.“We’re definitely under the cap, but any more that we spend on a player not playing, we can use later on,” Vigneault said after Saturday’s practice at Chelsea Piers, having given his players off Sunday before returning Monday for three days of practice leading into the season opener.“I’m looking at the big picture,” Vigneault added.",
        "“That’s what I’m talking about.”The Blueshirts have $47.825 million annually locked up in eight players — Rick Nash, Derek Stepan, Chris Kreider, Mats Zuccarello, Marc Staal, Dan Girardi, Ryan McDonagh and Henrik Lundqvist. (And imagine if captain McDonagh wasn’t signed for such a club-friendly $4.7 million per season?) So eight players make up about 68 percent of the club’s salary, and the other 15 players make up the remaining 32 percent.",
        "The lopsided nature is true on almost all NHL teams, leaving an onus on young, relatively cheap players to contribute in big roles.So as much as Vigneault’s ideal world contains a group with eight defensemen and 13 forwards, he knows it might not be the best scenario. If new defensemen Nick Holden and Adam Clendening are both scratched for the opener — which it seems they will be, barring a swing in opinion over the next few days of practice — they are still counting against the cap without playing.",
        "The decision then has to be made whether they’re worth keeping around to not play while losing future cap flexibility.Clendening would have to clear waivers to be sent down to AHL Hartford, while waiving Holden would likely mean the Rangers would lose him for nothing.",
        "Yet if 22-year-old Brady Skjei struggles early on, it might not be a short leash or short patience that gets him sent down without waivers, but the cap implications.The biggest difference from years past is the level of uncertainty that remains with what the Rangers have. They don’t know what to expect from Girardi coming off an awful season, preceded by so many good ones.",
        "Staal had a good camp, but is he back to being the aggressive and stout defenseman the team so desperately needs?There is youth up front in Jimmy Vesey, Pavel Buchnevich and Mika Zibanejad, but how consistent can they be in carrying the offensive weight?",
        "Can Brandon Pirri keep scoring like he did in preseason, can Michael Grabner stay healthy and actually help the penalty kill, and can Josh Jooris be a steadying fourth-line center?There are so many questions that can’t be answered yet, and it does very little good to try to guess what will happen.",
        "Instead, Vigneault and the front office are waiting with somewhat bated breath to see exactly what they have.“I’m thinking that we might, for a short amount of time, until we sort things out, see different players in NHL competition. We might keep 23,” Vigneault said. “But I’m not 100 percent sure yet.”He’s not 100 percent sure because it’s unknown just what kind of team the Rangers are right now. And when they find out, they want the financial ability to be able to change on the fly."

        "College Hockey:Clarkson Pounds Host WisconsinTwo Goals in Three Minutes Doom BadgersMADISON, Wis. — Talk about pulling a 180 over a span of 180 seconds.In just three minutes during the second period against No.",
        "15 Clarkson Friday night, the Badgers went from tying the game 1-1 to falling behind 3-1.A three-goal second period and a hat trick from senior captain Nick Dodge lifted Clarkson to a 6-2 victory, its sixth in a row, and relegated UW-the host of the Badger Hockey Showdown-to the consolation game Saturday.“I think we came out and took it to them pretty good for most of the game,” Dodge said.",
        "“We came in pretty confident about our game.”“It wasn’t just one thing, it was just everything,” UW assistant captain Jake Dowell said.",
        "“If we had to, we could use the excuse saying we missed a little time and we were rusty maybe for a period we could say that, but there is no excuse for not playing hard.“And it was everybody tonight.”Dodge gave Clarkson an early lead with his first goal of the game midway through the first period and the Golden Knights carried that edge for nearly 20 minutes before Wisconsin tied the game, though only momentarily.Working on the power play, the Badgers cycled the puck around until Dowell came free in the left circle.",
        "Ross Carlson found him and Dowell buried a one-timer over David Leggio’s right shoulder to make it 1-1 and give the Badgers a bit of momentum at 8:31.But it took just 21 seconds for that momentum to swing back the other way, and it was Dodge again who came through with the answer that the Golden Knights were looking for.He charged untouched toward the side of the net and collected the puck to the left of Elliott with a wide open left side.",
        "Elliott sprawled back, but was only able to get his stick down and Dodge lifted the puck up and over for his eighth goal of the year.“One of the things that we need to learn is coming back and not letting down,” UW senior Jeff Likens said. “We tie it up, we’ve got to keep going and keep playing.”Less than three minutes later, Clarkson doubled its lead.Elliott blocked an initial shot from Tyrell Mason, but left the rebound out right to senior Michael Grenzy.",
        "The blue-liner wound up from the right circle and blasted one under the right arm of Elliott.It was clear that those three minutes were the difference.“Any time you can come back and get a goal right after they score and take the crowd out of it and then come back and get another one I really thought that was the difference in the game,” Clarkson head coach George Roll said.“That span there is what, if you viewed the game, would be a turning point,” UW head coach Mike Eaves said.",
        "“I think that was the difference in the game when you look at the big picture.”The Badgers’ woes continued and nearly seven minutes later, the Golden Knights essentially slammed the door with their third goal of the second period.Mason and Shea Guthrie teamed up for their second assists in as many goals, this time on a four-on-four situation.",
        "This time they found Chris D’Alvise in the right circle and he beat Elliott with a shot into the far corner to make it 4-1 and the rout was on.And for as much as the goal-scoring was on, so was Leggio, who made a variety of stops to thwart any chance of a comeback.“I played poorly and their goalie played great,” Elliott said.",
        "“I think that was the difference in the game.”Leggio made 29 saves to gain his 11th victory of the season, while Elliott allowed six goals, tying a career-high in falling to 6-10-1.Dodge completed his hat trick just three minutes into the final period.",
        "Grenzy scored his second of the game seven minutes later and UW freshman Andy Bohmbach scored his first collegiate goal to cap off the scoring.It was clear that the time off over the holiday break coupled with the absence of three players at the World Junior Championships hurt the Badgers, but Eaves was disappointed nonetheless.“I factor that in, but the disappointing thing is why couldn’t we come back and play hard?” Eaves questioned.Roll also acknowledged that Wisconsin was not at full strength, but said he was not going to take anything away from his players, especially Dodge who put the team on his back to ensure that the Golden Knights came out hungry and rust-free.Clarkson will take on Lake Superior State in the tournament’s championship game at 4:07 p.m.",

        "Chanukah means “dedication” and celebrates the miracle of a day’s worth of oil used in the Temple lasting for eight days. The holiday commemorates the re-dedication of the (second) Temple in Jerusalem after it had been defiled under the rule of Antiochus IV Epiphanes.BACKGROUND: Judaism had been outlawed and in 167 BC Antiochus Epiphanes ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple and for pigs to be sacrificed.",
        "The sacrifice of pigs to the Greek gods was standard ritual practice in the Ancient Greek religion. Antiochus’s actions provoked a large-scale revolt.THE MACCABEE BROTHERS: Mattathias (Mattityahu), a Jewish priest, and his five sons Jochanan, Simeon, Eleazar, Jonathan and Judah led a rebellion against Antiochus Epiphanes. Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi (“Judah the Hammer”).",
        "By 166 BC Mattathias had died and Judah took his place as leader.THE VICTORY: By 165 BC the Maccabean revolt was successful, and the Temple was liberated and rededicated. After the forces of Antiochus had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the olive oil used to keep the 7-branch Menorah in the Temple lit had been profaned and couldn’t be used.",
        "They found a single vial that was still sealed by the High Priest with enough oil to keep the Menorah in the Temple lit for only one day but it took 8 days for new oil to be pressed from olives and made ready for use in the Menorah.",
        "The miracle that Chanukah commemorates is that one days worth of oil burned for eight days; enough time for the new oil to be pressed and made ready.HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS: The story of Chanukah is preserved in the books of the First and Second Maccabees which describe in detail the re-dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah. These books are not part of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) but are found in the Apocryphal books.",
        "The Jewish historian Josephus also writes about this in his renowned book, Antiquities of the Jews.Chanukah is also mentioned in the New Testament in John 10;“At that time the Feast of Dedication [ChanukHOW WE CELEBRATE: Jews celebrate by lighting an 8-branch candleabra with an additional candle each night for 8 nights. The middle candle, called the Shamash is the ‘helper’ candle that lights the others.",
        "We also eat foods fried in oil for each of the 8 nights and depending where Jews originate from, those foods differ. Ashkenazi Jews who are of Eastern European descent eat “latkes” which are are shallow-fried pancakes of grated potato, flour and egg and usually flavoured with grated onion. Latkes may be topped with a variety of condiments ranging from savory (e.g. sour cream) to sweet (e.g. apple saucer) or they may be served plain.",
        "Sephardic Jews who are of Middle Eastern descent eat various kinds of doughnuts and fritters, depending on the country of origin. In Israel, “sufganiyot” (סופגניות) are eaten, which are small round doughnuts filled with jelly or custard and topped with powered sugar. Like most Jewish celebrations, Chanukah is a time for family to gather and to share special food.",
        "It is also a time for games with a four sided top called a “dreydl” that has the four first letters of the expression “nes gadol haya sham” (נס גדול היה שם) which means ‘a great miracle happened there’NOT JEWISH CHRISTMAS: Chanukah is not one of the major holidays of the Jewish Calendar as are Passover, Rosh Hoshanah (New Year), Sukkot (Feast of Tabernacles), Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) or Shevouth (Feast of Weeks / Pentecost).",
        "It is a minor festival but because it falls shortly before Christmas some families have elevated it to a significant occasion. While gifts are not traditionally given for Chanukah, parents usually give their children “Chanukah gelt” (Yiddish for ‘money’) and oftenthese gifts of money are associated with their children’s dedication to their studies.",
        "Chocolate coins in little sacks are also often given.REMEMBERING GOD: Like other Jewish holidays, Chanukah commemorates God acting on behalf of His people. The blessing that is said each night as the Chanukiah is lit (usually by the children) refers to God having ‘wrought miracles for our fathers in days of old’. As we celebrate this season, be it Chanukah or Christmas and for some, both may we remember God and all He has done for us. And may we be a people marked by thankfullness.!",

        "on March 16, 2004, when the proposal to create a wireless mesh network in downtown Fullerton is presented to the Council for funding.Charles Kalil, Information Manager, City of Garden, described the evolution and implementation of that city's wireless network. Charles' predecessor initiated the installation of a wireless system in 1999 for the purpose of connecting six police substations. Worldwide Wireless, now known as Global Pacific, connected the six sites at a cost of $60,000.",
        "The project was eventually canceled. Garden Grove then investigated the possibility of connecting public safety facilities with DSL telephony, but found that the city would have to pay commercial rates. The cost to the police for operating Motorola radios was $65,000 per year. Consequently, a search began for a less expensive solution.5G Wireless, Marina del Rey, proposed a point-point system utilizing 802.11b technology with data rates of 3.0-3.5 Mbps.",
        "An antenna was placed on city hall with reception at all substations. The cost of the system was $9,000 for the main antenna and $1,500 for each substation. All police substations (9) and fire stations (7) are now linked wirelessly. The network runs on Linux with 128-bit encryption. Interference has been a problem at only one fire station and the maintenance yard has experienced some dropout. The signal passes through or around some trees and buildings.",
        "Most sites are elevated relative to their surroundings.Enterprise System Consulting recommended that Alvarion equip the 802.11b system with frequency hopping. With this system it is possible to connect vehicles such as police cars that are moving at speeds up to 60 mph. It is anticipated that it will take 32-40 access points to cover the city with wireless connectivity. The total cost to build out the city is estimated to be $300,000 including the installation of wireless units in vehicles.",
        "The cost to equip each police car including installation is about $5,000. Police equipped with PDAs will be able to connect wirelessly to the system and back to headquarters through the units in the police cars.Bell Gardens and Laguna Beach have similar wireless networks. Westminster has some hot spots.",
        "Grant money is available for the construction of wireless infrastructure for public safety.Helen Hall and Paul Stover graciously agreed to be responsible for preparing a PowerPoint presentation in support of the proposal to create a wireless mesh network in downtown Fullerton. Paul and Helen will also make the presentation to the Council. The goal is to obtain redevelopment funds in the amount of $56,000 in order to conduct this pilot project.",
        "A wireless system for the Fullerton library is included in the request.Possible presentation by Verilan or CingularNext steps regarding wireless implementation for downtown FullertonReview of action itemsStuart Davis, Stellans Technologies, a wireless networking company based in Fullerton and a colleague of Working Group member Johnson Lew, offered to donate equipment and labor to create a wireless network in the Fullerton library.",
        "Stellans recently completed installing a wireless network in the Anaheim Hilton. Stuart and Johnson said that in a few hours Stellans could set up the wireless network using excess equipment that it already has on hand. The Working Group expressed its appreciation and referred Stuart to Helen Hall and Al Milo, Library Director, for further discussion of the offer.There being no further business, Chair Burtner asked for a motion to adjourn the meeting.",
        "The motion to adjourn was made by David Bailey, seconded by Paul Stover and unanimously approved by the members present. The meeting adjourned at 10:25am."

        "With regular 1. FFC Frankfurt captain Nadine Angerer injured, experienced midfielder Sandra Smisek will wear the armband in next Thursday's UEFA Women's Champions League final against Olympique Lyonnais. The 34-year-old former Germany international speaks about her excitement at the Olympiastadion showdown and explains why she does not mind being called \"Grandma\".UEFA.com: Frankfurt are in a big European final for the first time in a few years. You must be delighted.Sandra Smisek: Of course.",
        "We haven't been playing in Europe for a while. Every athlete loves to compete with the best, and in the club game that means the Champions League. That is why we are very happy to have made it to the final.UEFA.com: You personally won the old UEFA Women's Cup twice. Is the competition even more special now it has changed its name?Smisek: The name itself sounds better as the UEFA Champions League final. Also it's played over one game, whereas it used to be played over two legs.",
        "I think it's better to play once.UEFA.com: What will be the key to beating Lyon?Smisek: That's a good question. Lyon are a very good team with top quality players. We're happy that it will be Lyon because we already know 1. FFC Turbine Potsdam from the league. It will be an interesting game, 50-50 I think. Form on the day will decide it, and character – the will to bring the title back home.",
        "I will give my all for it to be Frankfurt.UEFA.com: Is it an advantage to be playing the final in Germany?Smisek: Not necessarily. Of course it is nice for us to have a kind of home game. But I don't think Frankfurt would prepare differently if we were playing somewhere else. Maybe there are details that will give us a little advantage, but they will not be decisive ones.UEFA.com: Would victory represent a career highlight?Smisek: Absolutely. It's a long time since we've been here.",
        "I don't get so many chances to win trophies these days, and that's why I'm looking forward to it. I stopped playing for the national team in 2008, so I only have my club left. That's why it has a big importance for me personally.UEFA.com: Frankfurt's European campaign has been a rollercoaster ride, with away defeats in the first three rounds...Smisek: From the beginning we faced strong opponents with great skill and it was difficult away from home.",
        "But I think it's an advantage to play tough games on the way to a final and to knock out some strong opponents. Lyon will be our toughest opponent yet, but I think we deserve to be in the Champions League final.UEFA.com: How does it feel to be wearing the armband in Nadine Angerer's absence?Smisek: It would be better if Nadine wasn't injured and I didn't have to wear this thing on the pitch. But I am vice-captain so it's normal. I don't mind doing it, someone needs to take over the responsibility.",
        "I have been given it and I think I'm doing it quite well.UEFA.com: Desirée Schumann will come in to replace Angerer in goal. It's a big test for her, but she's looked assured so far.Smisek: Absolutely. She was already impressing a lot in training before Nadine got injured. Whenever she has played she has been very focused. She has a great personality. Schumann has shown us we can trust her despite her young age.UEFA.com You have a very young coach too in Sven Kahlert.",
        "What is he like?Smisek: He's very meticulous and passionate about his role. His coaching team of four are doing a good job and they give us a lot of good and tough sessions. They are putting us on the right track.UEFA.com: Frankfurt general manager Siggi Dietrich dubbed you the 'Grande Dame' not long ago. Is that flattering or would you rather not be seen as the old head?Smisek: I very often get called 'Grandma'. I know it's meant in a nice way and sometimes I get other compliments.",
        "I'm the oldest in the squad and I perform well at this level. So if they want to call me that, they can."

        "For the Reporter-HeraldThis can be a wonderful season of the year, when families come together, friendships are rekindled, and the hope for peace is everywhere. But unfortunately, for some people, there can also be the a-a-choo that seems to come with the season.Sneezing, sinus congestion, fatigue — it could just be the common cold, but researchers recently pointed to a surprising possible cause for the uptick in allergy like symptoms that is seen over the holidays.",
        "And aghast, the culprit may be one of the most beloved symbols of the season: the Christmas tree.In the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, researchers from the State University of New York noted that \"respiratory illnesses peak around Christmas.\"\"Within two weeks of putting a tree up, you can experience symptoms due to either the smell of pine resin in 'live' trees or various molds found in the trees,\" wrote American Family Care (AFC), a national health care system of urgent and family care facilities.In the past, physicians and researchers had thought that the rise in cold-like symptoms over the holidays were \"sparked by tree pollen and weed killer applied to trees,\" according to AFC.In 2011, the State University researchers noted that the trigger was more likely the, \"molds found in live Christmas trees.\" In fact, 70 percent of the molds on the trees were suspect.The American Christmas Tree Association (ACTA) notes that because most trees for purchase, \"are harvested well in advance of Christmas and stored in moist holding areas prior to settling in your home, undesirable mold spores have time to develop and grow.",
        "When you bring one of these live trees inside, these same microscopic spores that usually float freely outdoors, float freely in the enclosed sanctuary of your home.",
        "Floating molds create an atmosphere that can make someone with allergies quite susceptible to asthma and increasing sinus issues,\" wrote ACTA.But before you decide to haul your tree to the recycling center, AFC and ACTA offer several things you can do to lessen the chances of what is referred to as Christmas Tree Syndrome.Both organizations recommend washing off the tree and letting it dry before bringing it into the home.",
        "That idea might not always be feasible in changing Colorado where temperature could turn your efforts into natural icicles on the branches. But on warmer days, this is a positive option for removing mold spores from the tree.Wearing gloves and a long-sleeved shirt as you bring the tree inside can also help. This can keep you from touching sap, which contains terpene and other substances that can irritate skin and mucous membranes, noted ACTA.Dr.",
        "Johnny Shen, a board-certified physician with American Family Care's Doctors Express, an urgent and family care center in Cherry Creek, notes that they do see an increase in the number of patients coming in with allergy type symptoms during the Christmas season.\"But we don't immediately chock it up to Christmas Tree Syndrome. For the most part it wouldn't be the first thing we think of,\" said Shen. He pointed to the importance of getting a good history before determining the cause.",
        "\"There's a list of questions we might ask. 'Have you been exposed to mold dust? Have you been up in the mountains? If you get closer to the tree does your wheezing or other symptoms increase?\"Shen cautions against self-diagnosing. \"Go see a doctor if you have shortness of breath.",
        "If you have a fever, make sure it's not an infection — you may have a bacterial infection that needs to be treated.\"If it is determined that you most likely do have an allergic reaction to Christmas trees, there are some things you can do that may help. To avoid molds, avoid trees that have been cut and stored for some time. A freshly cut tree may work better for you.",
        "If you are allergic to pine oil or pine pollen (conifer pollen), then the freshly cut ones may cause you more problems.\"If you have allergies, maintain good air flow by using an air purifier,\" suggested Shen. \"We'd recommend not keeping your tree longer than four to seven days in the house.\"Before you rush out and decide to purchase an artificial tree, be aware that they can also induce allergic reactions, usually from dust. Remember to cover your artificial tree and store it to avoid excessive dust.",
        "When you pull it out for the new season, take a moment to wipe it down.For those who are prone to allergies, taking a few precautions can help them enjoy the beauty of their Christmas tree and avoid the discomfort of Christmas Tree Syndrome."

You can download Nickeloden all-star brawl on your PC, ps4, ps5, or Xbox.GraphicsDevelopers focused mostly on the idea of the game, so graphics are quite usual for 2D animation.",
        "They are vibrant and dynamic but lack details. Characters are drawn in the same style, so even if they are from different cartoons, they will look quite similar. However, the colors are bright and pleasant. The movements change really quickly what makes the whole process fun and enjoyable.ReplayabilityNickelodeon all-star brawl has various characters, and you may play it for hours. It’s great for several minutes breaks and kids will like it too.",
        "However, it doesn’t have any level progression, and locations are generic, which lowers the replayability rating. This is a type of game which you can play for a long time, forget about it abruptly, and return to it several months later. It has an avarage replayability level among other free games of this genre.GameplayAs written above, this game is based on combats between diverse Nickelodeon characters. It has various locations where you can play face to face or together with many players.",
        "There are no levels. You may get some items as gifts but they don’t play a big role in your fighting development. Playing Nickeloden all-star brawl is not very convenient on Xbox. You should use diverse buttons combinations, which is easier to do with a joystick. So, Nickelodeon all-star brawl for Xbox is a better choice.",
        "It’s quite easy to control characters, and they move extremely fast for a 2D game like this.Some players note that even though the game was created with Nickeloden in mind, the atmosphere there is not like cartoons have. There is a lack of music and some characters look a little differently than in movies. But some fans are all steamed up about the game.",
        "Overall, you may install Nickelodeon all-star brawl because it’s very funny and allows you to try various characters in combats.ConclusionThe game is nice and perfect for those who like Nickelodeon cartoons. Even if you have never watched any of them, you can enjoy this game because of the high-level motion gameplay and variety of characters. This is not the game where you can develop your character and gain some levels.",
        "Here you can just download Nickelodeon all-star brawl relax and get fun.Pros:- Dynamic and vibrant- A lot of characters- Has many locations.Cons:- No level progression- Low-level graphics.How much storage do you need?"

File History allows users to backup incremental revisions of files and then restore them from a secondary storage device.Of course, Microsoft updated File History in Windows 10.",

Until the company confirms the removal of File History, users can still benefit from it.As for the future, those in doubt can also create backups in Windows 10 using third-party software.",

        "It's been another rollercoaster, as squeezing it all in with everything else is just madness, but to my surprise (although there are scripts waiting to be read even as I write) it is proving possible.The Show alternates between dramatic storytelling by Deor, storyteller/solo renditions of classic plays, so far Greek tragedy! and plays sent in by playwrights, so far ones with access to their own recording studios and actors, which is brilliant.",
        "We have been amazed and delighted at the quality of the work sent in, and as the Phonic Drama Show swings between experimental and Exeter's answer to Radio 4, so the fortnightly 'Widsith and Deor Presents...' has been making occasional stabs at being the city's reply to Radio 3...no comments on how it's been going, we have no producer but ourselves!The solo Greek tragedies, Euripedes' 'The Bacchae' and his (almost unwatchable and unlistenable in the grim stakes as well as so loaded that it was banned by the Greek colonels in the 1960's) 'Trojan Women' have both been performed by Deor.",
        "I have to admit I wasn't sure it could be done, as both have quite a number of characters! But was astounded, as ever by his versatility. 'The Bacchae' is one of the most beautiful plays ever written, with incredibly poetic language, and one of those tragedies that is, for me, like Macbeth - there are times when you want to cry, but, like the opera Carmen, somehow everything is as it should be, and the gods or the witches or the cards have their way, and strangely it seems right in that context.",
        "The Trojan Women by contrast is one of the grimmest and possibly finest, and certainly earliest known, of anti-war plays ever written. It deals with war from the what-happen-to-the-civilians? view - the women after the city is captured. Enough said.In the storytelling shows, Deor has been doing epic cycles from the Finnish Kalevala, and this morning's show was of Viking myths of the gods, but told as a series, with background techno/dance tracks to up the tempo and tension.",
        "It was powerful stuff - well, I was moved, and I've heard some of them many times before. The interpretation took up the usual mantle of blood-thirsty gore and comic book slapstick of the Norse gods' tales and turned them into a well-forged blade, dipped in ironies and laden with extra depths, multi-faceted, bringing out the real tragedy and the dark politics involved in a way that I've seldom heard done with Nordic retellings.",
        "A heady brew!Once a month at the moment there's a 'Storyclub Special' where whatever we've managed to record from that month's Storyclub gets played on the show. I say 'managed' as Michael Dacre must've put a copyright spell on his tales, as the machine never plays back his brilliant tellings!More new plays are in the pipeline, including a political satire by the author of our first featured play the tragi-comedic 'The Rose Garden', Simon Jackson a professional writer and film maker based in Edinburgh.",
        "We are also looking for Devon and Exeter based playwrights, so if you have something, and especially if you can produce/record it yourself, we would be interested to hear it! Just e-mail it to me, the Editor at the usual e-mail.1 week ago"

        "1:48pm PT by Josh Wigler'Game of Thrones' Finale: Forecasting the Mad Queen's Fall[Warning: This story contains spoilers from the season six finale of HBO's Game of Thrones, \"The Winds of Winter.\"]\"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.\"With those sharp-tongued season one words, Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) set the tone for all the ensuing political maneuvering and murdering on Game of Thrones.",
        "But now that she's sitting on the throne, it appears there's some miserable middle ground after all.Throughout her time on Thrones, the House Lannister lioness has clawed and roared at all enemies in her path, decimating any visible threat posed against her family.",
        "But despite all attempts at keeping her children safe, Cersei watched as all three died, one after another: Joffrey (Jack Gleeson), poisoned at his own royal wedding; Myrcella (Nell Tiger Free), poisoned in Dorne; and Tommen (Dean-Charles Chapman), poisoned by the words and actions of too many bad advisors — his own mother included.In the wake of Cersei's wildfire assault on the Sept of Baelor, and in the wake of Tommen's subsequent suicide, Cersei now sits upon the throne she so desperately tried to protect for her children through all of these years — now completely childless, with very few friends and very many enemies.",
        "Yes, she won the game of thrones, but only for now, and only after the most precious people in her life died. And given the odds stacked against her, it's only a matter of time before she loses the great game for good.There are thousands of different directions left for Game of Thrones as the HBO series enters its endgame, but for Cersei, there's only one outcome: defeat.",
        "It's only a matter of how she'll lose, and that's where the options become many.The most obvious threat is the arrival of a new queen: Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), sailing from Meereen toward Westeros at long last, bringing a bountiful army, critical alliances and three fire-breathing dragons with her. But perhaps Dany's greatest asset in a war against House Lannister is Tyrion (Peter Dinklage), the most reviled figure in Cersei's world.",
        "If season seven doesn't feature a final showdown between the Lannister siblings, then there truly is no justice.A secondary threat is a second Lannister brother: Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), Cersei's twin, lover, and the father of her deceased children. Two episodes before the finale, Jaime doubled down on his unending love for Cersei.",
        "But the look the twins exchanged in their final moments of the season spoke volumes: Jaime, a man who killed a king to save thousands of lives, was forced to confront the reality that the most important person in his life just followed in the Mad King's footsteps. In the face of further fire, the Kingslayer could become the Queenslayer.In both the cases of Dany and Jaime, their roles in Cersei's eventual takedown would fulfill the conditions of Maggy the Frog's prophecy.",
        "The old witch told Cersei she would outlive her own children, that she would rule until a \"younger and more beautiful\" queen casts her down, and that she would ultimately die at the hands of the \"valonqar,\" High Valyrian for \"little brother.\" Jaime is Cersei's younger sibling by seconds.Beyond those external threats, there are internal foes, including Cersei's inner circle.",
        "She's flanked by only two trusted allies at this point: Maester Qyburn (Anton Lesser) and Gregor Clegane (Hafthor Bjornsson), two decidedly deadly individuals for very different reasons. Do they have Cersei's best interests at heart, ultimately?",
        "Qyburn's motives remain an unsettling mystery, while the Mountain does little more than follow Cersei's precise orders — a directive that typically ends in gruesome gore.With that in mind, however, the truth becomes clear: when it comes to Cersei's downfall, all roads lead right back to Cersei and her call for violence.",
        "Her destructive actions have brought her to this point, and are bound to bury her in the end, whether it's because she instigates someone into action, or because she enacts a plan that backfires in literally explosive fashion.\"I choose violence,\" Cersei said earlier in season six, three words that echo throughout the character's arc — and words that will undoubtedly be with her when her time on Thrones inevitably ends.Watch the video for more on the season finale's highlights:Follow THR's Game of Thrones coverage for more deep dives, interviews and news.Josh WiglerTHRnews@thr.com @thr"

        "surface that the sick ones have touched, licked, drank out of, peed on, thrown up on, slept on, walked on, or breathed on with disinfecting wipes and lysol spray does not work.Quarantining the ill ones to one room in the house does not work.Sanitizing all the tooth brushes does not work.Come ON!What's the big mystery here PEOPLE???It's enough to send me racing to the brink of insanity.And just when the first group is feeling better, getting back into the swing of things, and you've got the floors bleached and all the linens washed, folded, and put away.....the next group starts up.....at bedtime, of course.Out of the 8 of us, 5 have surrendered to its tortures.All girls.The boys have stood strong.My husband was on the cusp of being broken by it's grip.The evening following the attack on Ashlyn and I, he started feeling nauseous and had the cold sweats.But fortunately for all of us, he held strong and didn't give in.Last night, it turned it's cold fingers to our oldest son.He did throw up once and has been slightly feverish and achy today, but that's it.The only one who has gone completely unphased and has enjoyed the unusual routines of the last week is our youngest son.We'll see.I have no idea if we'll make it to church on Sunday.This monster strikes unexpectedly.Your stomach starts hurting just all-of-a-sudden.You throw up once and feel better.You can walk around and have conversation and feel like your out of the woods.But as time goes on....the pain and nausea intensifies.It peaks and comes to a head after about 12 hours wherewith you finally can collapse into sleep.My youngest son wouldn't do well by that.He can't even wake up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, much less be aware that he needs to get to the toilet to throw up!!So I would have to have him on a sheet on the floor next to me all night long.I would have to be able to hear him getting sick in time to roll him over to a pan or something before it goes all over him and the floor!!It's exhausting.I have been an emotional wreck all week.I hate to hear my girls crying for me to make it stop.Begging me for some medicine to make it better......or to make them throw up.Listening to them gasping for air.Ashlyn has had the hardest time with her Diabetes.But that is for another post.When I'm not so tired.When I can see the humor in it all.Right now, I'm just pondering why on earth this week?We have laid plans for this year.Good plans.We're excited about what lies ahead.Just as we open the door and step into some new beginnings....SLAM!Right on our faces!!So, now we feel a few steps behind.....and it's just the first week.2 comments:Brenda, in between being sick, you should have posted a quick, \"We're sick.",
        "Pray for us!\" post. When I read your post this morning, I prayed for you and your family. You had wonderful plans to start the new year; but, Someone wiser than us had other plans for your family. He can use this to bring good. I'll be praying for you. Try to get some rest. And don't go to church if you think someone might be still contagious! You don't want to spread this! Hang in there! This too shall pass. : )I feel for you and I truly understand your pain.",
        "7 out of the 8 of us got the flu one week before Christmas. One week before 3 family Christmas parties I was having at my home. I thought that I was going to go insane. My husband was the only one that made it without throwing up.I hope that everyone is feeling better and that is the end of sickness for 2011 for your family!!"

        "If an Englishman’s home is his castle, his family home is undoubtedly his Buckingham Palace. They’re unimaginably precious to us, holding our memories and identities, biro-drawn height charts, and idiosyncrasies that estate agents can’t begin to appreciate the value of. This, of course, makes the prospect of selling all the harder. So what do you need to consider when selling? We’d start by doing the following…1. Detach and de-sentimentalise.",
        "First, and foremost, practise a bit of emotional detachment: consider it the ultimate in decluttering. By letting go of material possessions (in this case, almost all of them at once and the brickwork, oak floors and Farrow and Ball paint too), you can free yourself for new adventures and space for new memories. It’s hard to walk around the rooms our children grew up in and see them as little more than selling points, but removing the romanticism will help you to start a new chapter.2.",
        "Persuade your family members to do the same. You might be surprised (or not, depending on how vocal your offspring usually are) to find that grown up children are the most resistant to selling the family home… the very walls hold a great deal of power over kids who have flown the nest, even if they now have children themselves. Throughout tumultuous break ups, career moves and milestones, the building and its contents (and you within it) has been their one constant point of reference.",
        "Give everyone plenty of time to come around to the idea, and warn them when professional photos and for sale signs are going up: it will come as less of a shock.3. Decide how you’re going to sell it, and to whom. How are you going to make a sale? Will you enlist the services of We Buy Any House, or offer it to the highest bidder at an auction? Would you feel most comfortable using an estate agent, or would you prefer to make a sale via a private agreement?",
        "Decide on the hows and whos of selling, as this will help to make handing over the deeds feel like the right decision.4. Have an interim plan. Doubtless you’re on the precipice of change: be it travelling, downsizing or renting. Make sure you have somewhere to go and a way of funding your lifestyle until you’re settled into your new normal. Sales can take a while and things can get expensive if events don’t unfold as you’re expecting, so have a back up plan and a place to stay.5.",
        "Be clear about what you want for the future. It’s no good selling if it feels like a poor exchange, so before you put it on the market, be very clear about what you want your next place to look like. Where will it be? How big is it? What input does it require from you to make it feel like it’s yours? Who will visit? How will it fit into your life going forward? Write a list of answers responding to questions like these.",

        "Tiger wrestlers enjoy team, individual success in ‘12-’13.“We had a great season,” said coach Troy Ostby. “We ended the season right where we should have been.”The Tigers reached all but one of their goals this season, and that was making it to the final four in the Section 3AA team tournament. The Tigers won their first match to advance to the quarterfinals, but Lac qui Parle Valley/Dawson-Boyd ended the Tigers’ team season.The Tigers lose four wrestlers to graduation.",
        "They are seniors Connor Metzger, Joel Harrison, Evan Nelson, and Seth Nelson.“These are four kids that have come up through our program,” said Ostby. “They have shown leadership and won big matches for us.”Evan Nelson finished the season 29-15, taking fourth at the section tourney. Nelson wrapped up his career 79-60 overall.“You could always count on him down low to keep us in the dual,” said Ostby. “I expected him to win.”Seth Nelson finished 8-19, taking fifth at sections.",
        "He had a career record of 41-71.“Seth came on in the end of the season. He won a couple of matches that helped us win duals,” said Ostby. “Because of his win, we won a couple duals.”Metzger was a state entrant, taking second in sections, and finished the season 34-8. Metzger placed fifth at the state tournament. Metzger finished his career 85-51.“Connor’s hard work and dedication made him a good leader,” said Ostby. “He was expected to win. No matter if he was wrestling a No.",
        "1 ranked wrestler or not.”Harrison wrapped up his senior season 28-7, just missing a state trip by dropping a true-second match to take third in the section. He wrapped up his career in orange and black with a 70-53 record.“He was the hardest worker on the team by far,” said Ostby. “Connor will admit that because of Joel, he went to state.“We’re going to miss these boys,” added Ostby.",
        "“They were like big brothers to the young kids.”Several young kids are coming up to help fill the spots left open by the seniors, including 17 wrestlers with at least some varsity experience.Junior Dillan Johnson, the other Tiger state entrant, took first place in Section 3AA and finished the season 29-13.“Dillan had his best wrestling at the end of the year,” said Ostby.",
        "“His technique improved and he was finding ways to win the close matches.”Myles Smith finished the season 17-15 and took fourth at sections.“If he stays healthy, Myles will be in contention to go to state,” said Ostby. “He’s got all the tools.”Travis Ostby finished his freshman year 25-18, placing third at sections after losing a true-second match.“He’ll be a key in our middle weights,” said Ostby.",
        "“He can wrestle up a weight or two to help us match up well in duals.”Alec Gausman finished his sophomore year 9-24.“He’s going to be our big guy next year,” explained Ostby. “He’ll need to step up and be the anchor for us.”The highlight of the season for coach Ostby was finishing 12th of 35 teams at the Big Bear Tournament in December. The Tigers had five place winners at the invite.",
        "Ostby describes the invite as a “mini state tournament.”At the Belgrade-Brooten-Elrosa tournament, the Tigers placed fifth and had another five place winners. The Tigers took fourth at the Grant County Tournament, earning 10 individual place winners. At the Big Ole Tournament in Alexandria, the Tigers finished sixth and had seven wrestlers place. The Tigers were fourth at the West Central Conference Tournament, where eight Tigers placed.",
        "Travis Ostby, Evan Nelson, Connor Metzger, and Joel Harrison earned all-conference status at the meet. Dillan Johnson received an honorable mention.The regular season wrapped up with the Tigers’ home invite at which 11 wrestlers from the home team placed.“That was pretty impressive,” said Ostby. “It was awesome. With the talent we have we were right where we should have been. We peaked at the right time.”Ostby is looking forward to next season and is excited about the Tigers’ opportunities.",
        "Two teams, Adrian and Montevideo, will no longer be part of Section 3AA. Joining the Tigers’ section will be New Ulm. Adrian was the section champion this season and also took seven individuals to the state tournament.“That makes our chances even better in 2014,” explained Ostby. “That’s seven more spots for our kids to get to state.”Making it to the state tournament will require wrestlers to get in a lot of wrestling in the off-season and attend a couple of camps.",
        "Mick Rose is running a freestyle Greco league for K-12 wrestlers this summer.The Tigers experienced success in the classroom, as well as on the mat, earning the Silver Award for Academics with a GPA of 3.43.“The kids understand what it takes,” added Ostby. “Our goal is to win championships. We won’t be satisfied until we do.”"

Specifically, we examine what predicts governance changes and the level of governance itself.",
        "To conduct this study, we utilize a unique dataset from AllianceBernstein that consists of monthly firm-level corporate governance ratings for 24 emerging market countries for almost seven years. Since the AllianceBernstein ratings are time-series data, they allow us to determine the direction of change in a firm’s corporate governance, and the timing of these changes. Using these data, we find two main results. First, as firms grow they are more likely to improve their governance.",
        "Second, the level of political risk.مقدمه انگلیسیA large literature has generally found that better governance is linked to better performing and valued firms in emerging markets.1 Despite this evidence, and the clear incentive to improve their governance, many similar firms make very different governance choices. To better comprehend why firms choose different governance schemes, one needs to examine what predicts firm governance in these emerging economies. This paper adds to this discussion.",
        "There are number of papers that have begun to examine what factors predict firm governance decisions in emerging markets. However, the findings of these papers have been disparate. For example, Doidge et al. (2007) and Durnev and Fauver (2010) find that country conditions explain much more of the variance in firm governance ratings than firm characteristics. Indeed, according to Doidge et al. (2007), firm characteristics don’t predict governance much at all.",
        "Conversely, Black et al., 2006b, Durnev and Kim, 2005 and Klapper and Love, 2004 and Klapper et al. (2006) all find that some firm characteristics are important to governance decisions, however they find that quite different firm characteristics are predictive. Case in point, while Durnev and Kim (2005) find that firm growth, the firm’s need for equity finance, and the amount of insider ownership predict better governance, Black et al. (2006b) find that none of these characteristics are significant.",
        "Instead they find that firm size and firm risk predict better governance but little else does. To make matters more complicated, Klapper and Love (2004) find that capital intensity of the firm is a predictor of worse governance while the other papers do not find such a conclusion. Indeed, the one consistent finding seems to be that few factors, if any, consistently predict governance. In fact, Black et al.",
        "(2006b) test 17 different factors and many controls, and find that only firm size and firm risk have any consistent predictive ability governance in Korea. Indeed, other than these two variables nothing else predicts governance decisions in Korea. In another paper, Balasubramanian et al. (2010) also find that very little predicts governance when examining governance decisions in India. In this paper we also examine what factors predict firm governance in emerging markets.",
        "However, we do this in a different way than the previously mentioned papers. While the other papers all use cross-sectional data, in this paper we use a dataset from AllianceBernstein that consists of monthly, time-series, firm-level, corporate governance ratings for 24 emerging market countries that span almost seven years. These data allow us to examine changes in corporate governance.",
        "Hence, while previous studies can examine what country and firm characteristics are linked to better governance, we can examine what, if anything, is causing firm governance to improve or deteriorate over a period of time. We feel this is worthy supplement to the cross-sectional approach as it allows us to see the effects of changes (in the country and in the firm) on firm governance and thus assess if such changes are worth pursuing to improve governance.",
        "While our major focus is on predicting changes in governance, we also use the more traditional approach of investigating what predicts the level of governance. We do this using a fixed effects, panel approach. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in the study. Section 3 provides the methodology.",
        "In Section 4 we present our results and we conclude with Section 5.نتیجه گیری انگلیسیWhile a number of papers have examined which firm and country factors are related to firm governance, this paper is the first, to our knowledge, to examine whether changes and/or levels in specific variables, such as country risk and firm characteristics, predict changes in firm-level governance ( Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8 and Table 9).",
        "This is a worthy supplement to the cross-sectional approach as it allows readers to see the effects of changes in country/firm conditions on corporate governance and thus assess if such changes are worth pursuing to improve governance. In addition to seeing what predicts changes in firm-level governance we also examine what predicts the level and future changes in firm-level governance.",
        "Specifically we examine if the level of independent variables can predict the level of firm governance ( Table 10) and we examine if changes in the independent variables during an earlier period can predict changes in governance during a later period ( Table 11). To conduct this study we utilize a unique dataset from AllianceBernstein that consists of monthly firm-level corporate governance ratings for 24 emerging market countries that spans almost seven years.",
        "Since the AllianceBernstein ratings are time-series data, they allow us to determine when there are changes, and the magnitude of those changes, in a firm’s corporate governance. We find two main results that seem relatively robust to different specifications. First, changes in firm size are positively and significantly related to changes in firm governance. This implies that high firm growth predicts improvements in firm governance. Why this happens is still an open question.",
        "It may be that as firms grow they receive more attention from outside (and possibly foreign) investors who demand better governance to invest. It may also be that larger firms are more complicated firms and thus need better governance to run well. This is a subject for future research. Second, the level of political risk of the country. This latter result suggests that firms try to compensate for the high political risk by improving their governance. Lastly, our paper is not without caveats.",
        "It is possible that the AllianceBernstein measures are not the most accurate measures of firm-level governance. Indeed, as with all ratings systems, the AllianceBernstein ratings are quite subjective. Moreover, because they are based on the MSCI EM index they are largely based on relatively large firms so small firms are not included much in our sample.",
        "But again the advantage of the ICRG indices and the AllianceBernstein corporate governance ratings is that they provide a time-series while other cross-country studies of corporate governance use cross-sectional data."

A couple years after, I hear about the reveal of Lobby 2. At this point I freaked out. When it was released I played so much.",

The next spring, my computer broke, and at this time the Kickstarter/Indiegogo was released and I sadly missed it and I will never be able to forgive myself for missing it.

After long months of waiting, it was released.",
        "I bought the game immediately, but there was a file error (if anyone remembers that), so I went back on GMTower. It was so laggy from so much activity that I disconnected and waited for the file fix for Tower Unite. When it was fixed, I downloaded the game and immediately played virus with many and it was great. Months go by, and in August of 2016, I built my new PC with literally 3 things in mind, the ability to run GTA V at high+ graphics, run Overwatch at Epic, and Tower Unite at all TURBO.",

        ">> »»The Return of Moqtada al-SadrSeptember 2005.From the start of the intervention, al-Sadr spoke out against the United States' plans in Iraq. When Washington finally recognized the true threat that al-Sadr posed to the success of its intervention, he had already fortified his power in the vacuum that was created after the fall of the Ba'ath Party establishment. American forces detained some of his associates, and in response al-Sadr ordered his militia to attack U.S. positions.",
        "[See: \"What To Do With Moqtada Al-Sadr\"]Al-Sadr's April 2004 uprising briefly overwhelmed the U.S. military, which had been struggling to defeat the predominately Sunni Arab and foreign Islamist insurgency.",
        "It forced the Pentagon to divert its resources in Iraq from fighting this insurgency to dealing with the Mehdi Army; it also had a negative effect on the Bush administration's political situation since it appeared briefly that the United States was facing a popular uprising.In August 2004, al-Sadr launched another revolt. While the Mehdi Army caused many casualties to U.S. troops, they also took a pounding from American forces.",
        "Near the end of the August fighting, there was talk that Washington was considering assassinating al-Sadr, but his popularity within the Shi'a community made him too explosive for the U.S. to eliminate. [See: \"Terminating Al-Sadr Will Not Eliminate Shi'a Resistance\"]Therefore, al-Sadr called his militia to step down and shielded himself behind more prominent Shi'a religious leaders. The U.S. decided against assassination, and was happy to see an end to the Shi'a struggle. This gave the U.S.",
        "military the opportunity to concentrate its resources on the Sunni Arab and foreign Islamist insurgency.Al-Sadr and the Shi'a Religious EstablishmentIraq's Shi'a religious leaders chose to protect al-Sadr because of his popularity within the Shi'a community in Iraq, especially among the masses of poor.",
        "Additionally, the ability of al-Sadr to muster up his impressive militia in defense of Shi'a values remains an important asset for Shi'a leaders especially since the Shi'a community as a whole has been targeted by what appears to be former Ba'athists, Sunni Arab militant groups and foreign Islamists.However, Shi'a leaders wanted to participate in the political process since an Iraqi constitution would theoretically result in a power-sharing relationship that gives the Shi'a the most control due to the fact that they constitute a majority in Iraq.",
        "During this process, al-Sadr remained relatively quiet, and appeared to be pursuing a more political role. His Mehdi Army continued to provide security in Sadr City, but clashes between his militia and U.S.-led troops had ended.However, in the lead-up to the October 15, 2005 referendum on Iraq's proposed constitution, he returned to the public spotlight by rejecting the document. He also put on a demonstration of force through his Mehdi Army followers, as seen in the September 25 clash with U.S.",
        "and Iraqi troops. [See: \"The Implications of Iraq's Proposed Constitution\"]Additionally, it appears that in his rejection of the constitution, al-Sadr placed himself at odds with the rest of the Shi'a leadership. It is not clear whether his rejection was because of the separatism evident in the proposed constitution, or because of his refusal to participate in any aspect of a process that is affiliated with the U.S.",
        "since that would somewhat legitimize what al-Sadr perceives as a continued occupation.The Bottom LineAl-Sadr must remain careful because he is positioning himself against the Shi'a hierarchy, in addition to against U.S.-led troops. His Mehdi Army affords him a significant amount of negotiating leverage with these two factions, and both factions recognize his influence with the country's poor masses.",
        "That being said, by opposing the country's Shi'a religious leaders, such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, al-Sadr could alienate some of his followers.Indeed, it appears that in recent days al-Sadr has backtracked from opposing the Shi'a hierarchy.",
        "For instance, a senior al-Sadr aide, Hazem al-Araji, recently stated that al-Sadr's position on the proposed constitution \"is neutral,\" which was a change from his earlier rejection of the document.Look for al-Sadr to continue to display the force potential of his Mehdi Army militia, especially in the face of Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's declaration of war against Iraq's Shi'a population, in addition to the upsurge in violence that is predicted to occur as the October 15 referendum date draws near.Republished with the kind permission of the Power and Interest News Report.",

Instead, I went in search of an alcoholic high of a different kind.",
        "Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to meet chhyang:Chhyang is an alcoholic \"drink\" found in Nepal, Tibet, and throughout other parts of the Himalayan region. It is made most commonly with fermented rice but can be concocted using barley or millet. I'm not sure how the locals first discovered this brew (although I am certain it involved a bit of desperation), but I first encountered it the other night when a brave new acquaintance ordered it at dinner without batting an eye.",
        "Intrigued, I joined him, despite the warning I had recently received that such local firewater is usually made with untreated water and is thus a food poisoning death wish if under 40 percent alcohol. No one warned me that tasting the stuff would bring a death wish of its own. Legend has it that chhyang attracts the Yeti, known to raid Himalayan villages in search of a sip.",
        "Learning this, I fear that the Abominable Snowman is more abominable and beastly than we all dared imagine.I should pause a moment to point out that I am a storied lover of food and drink. To this day, I am proud that there are few things I find distasteful in the culinary realm. My wife (lovingly?) calls me her garbage disposal; I will eat anything. Such habits had me looking like this in third grade:But back to the chhyang.",
        "There is a more drinkable, and I think common, version technically called chamal ko chhyang.chamal ko chhyangThis stuff is served \"chilled\" (read: just below room temp). It's thick and a bit chunky, the consistency of very pulpy orange juice. It tastes like a sour, fermented, strong sake (Japanese rice alcohol). It is lightly carbonated, and my waiter encouraged me to drink quickly before it went flat. Bottoms up!The thicker stuff, pictured at the top of this post, is chamal ko chhyang bhuteko.",
        "As you can see, it is served in a bowl with a spoon. Taking a bite of your alcohol may seem like a slightly thrilling change of pace, but this is no jello shot from your college days. First of all, the alcoholic sludge is served hot and has a slimy texture that can be described in no other words than fresh snot. It tastes sweeter than the liquid chhyang, almost tart.",
        "But, with the boozy aftertaste, the final impression is of something from your fridge that's gone putrid out in the sun.So, while celebrating St. Patrick's Day wherever in the world you may be, I encourage you to raise a pint of your favorite tipple in a toast to friends, health, country, whatever you please. Please just assure me it's not a pint of fresh chhyang."

        "REVIEW: History of Wolves by Emily FridlundHISTORY OF WOLVES by Emily Fridlund is a coming-of-age story about a young girl who struggles to live within poverty with ex-hippies as parents in northern Minnesota. When she begins babysitting for the neighbors across the lake, she starts to feel a part of something bigger than herself.",
        "Until she witnesses and allows a terrible thing that will shape her life.The rambling style of the main character’s thoughts is addictive, even though it left me perplexed quite often. I loved the descriptions of the woods and nature. The author’s words illustrated the love and appreciation of the wild. I feel as if I’ve lived a childhood similar, running off through the woods in the 1960s because my parents needn’t worry about my safety.",
        "I wish I could have given that happy, carefree, childhood bliss of the innocent to my own children. But that unique world was too far gone by the time I became a parent. This novel’s descriptions make me wish for simpler times.Overall, I enjoyed the book, except for the sexual connotations that felt like they were coming from an abused individual. Linda showed no evidence of abuse, but she was very imbalanced in her thinking, often coming off as a sociopath.",
        "This isn’t always a comfortable book to read. I wonder if her deviant thoughts are used as a metaphor or simile to explain something that happened, or that she assumed or wished happened. At times, I felt these odd thoughts were placed for shock value to heighten anticipation. Since this story is mostly about growing up with ex-hippie parents and unusual friends and neighbors, the strangeness of the main character’s thoughts can be explained.",
        "But many times, I wondered if she was on the brink of a manic episode. Linda has an eerie, strange voice that’s captivating and addicting.My only disappointment is that I didn’t understand the final chapter, even after re-reading the last few chapters several times. I feel like I should understand it and I have some guesses, but I’m left wondering what I missed. This seems like one of those literary books that everyone will rave about but I won’t understand without discussing within a group.",
        "The other half of me is offended that I don’t get it and now I wonder what I missed.I had a very hard time coming up with a rating for this book because of the final chapter. The end leaves me with so many questions and disappointment. I’m not sure if I’m disappointed in myself because I don’t get it, or in the author because it isn’t clear. For that reason alone, I could rate this book a 3 but it doesn’t do it justice.",
        "For the bulk of the book that’s wondrously talented, plus my eager enjoyment, I’d rate it 4.5 to a 5, so I’ve compromised with a 4. It leaves me with the belief that each reader’s mileage will vary. My hope is that more of my friends will try this book so we can figure it out together!Originally attracted to the title and the cover, this story wasn’t like anything I expected.",
        "The significance of the title confused me until the end when I realized what affect one moment early in her childhood had on Linda’s life. Beyond what the title means to the main character, I believe HISTORY OF WOLVES represents a family nucleus as a pack of wolves. Yes, the mother and father are near, but there are far more influences on this adolescent’s life that flow into adulthood. I’ll always wonder about her story twenty years into the future.",
        "Will she always wander as a lone wolf?Author Emily Fridlund writes in a literary style that rambles eloquently, but in the same manner as human thoughts, zigzagging across several subjects at once. An articulate and creative author to watch, I’m super curious about her next endeavor.

        "By Cheryl PellerinAmerican Forces Press ServiceHONOLULU, April 3, 2014 here today.The 10 defense ministers of member countries that constitute the Association of Southeast Asian Nations accepted Hagel’s June invitation and participated in the discussions and roundtables with purpose and energy, the secretary said during the forum’s final news conference.“This gathering was an important milestone in America's growing engagement with the ASEAN nations, and another signal of the important role ASEAN has to play in promoting regional stability and prosperity,” Hagel observed.The Defense Department hosted the meeting, but the forum benefited from the participation of partners across the federal government, the secretary added, especially during yesterday’s session on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations hosted by Dr.",
        "Kathryn Sullivan, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, and moderated by Dr. Rajiv Shah, administrator of the U.S.",
        "Agency for International Development, or USAID.“Coming only hours after a tsunami advisory was lifted for Hawaii, the NOAA presentation and roundtable underscored that natural disasters and humanitarian crises will [define 21st century] security challenges, not only for Southeast Asia, but for the world,” Hagel said.“We can expect that the frequency and the complexity of disaster relief and humanitarian assistance missions will increase,” he noted, adding that such missions demand cooperation among nations and across their government agencies, nongovernmental organizations and their private sectors.“The discussions we had yesterday, which focused on lessons learned from recent operations, will help identify new proposals to improve our preparedness and cooperation in the future,” he told reporters.In discussions yesterday, for example, Singapore proposed using Changi Naval Base as a regional humanitarian assistance and disaster relief crisis coordination center.“This could be an important venue for nations in the region to coordinate military responses to disasters, and it's an idea that we're going to pursue,” the secretary said.",
        "“This was among many ideas that came out of our last couple of days of discussions.”Discussions today addressed a range of regional security matters, including improving maritime security cooperation and addressing tensions in the South China Sea, Hagel said.“I told the ministers that the United States is increasingly concerned about the instability arising from territorial disputes in the South China Sea,” he added. “The rights of all nations must be respected.",
        "It's important that all claimants avoid the use or threat of force or intimidation or coercion.”He said the United States urges all claimants of land in the disputes to clarify their claims, including the basis of the claims in international law, and to use internationally accepted rules and standards of behavior.Tomorrow, the secretary said, he will continue the rest of his fourth official visit to the Asia-Pacific region, including stops in Japan, China and Mongolia.“This trip and the ASEAN-U.S.",
        "Forum shows America's rebalance to the Asia-Pacific remains a critical part of our national security strategy,” Hagel said. “We are committed to the security and the prosperity of the region because of our interests, and also [because of] our close relationships, alliances and commitments.”He added, “America has a long-standing engagement and commitment with the Asia-Pacific region.",
        "It's a commitment that we will continue to meet in the 21st century.”(Follow Cheryl Pellerin on Twitter @PellerinAFPS)Related Sites:Special Report: Travels with Hagel"

        "European Commission Vice President, Andrus Ansip, last week announced plans to end territoriality for digital content distribution.The proposal is that Europe becomes one market, not a bunch of separate territories, for the purposes of content sales and especially sales of digital content, including many videogames and subscription services such as Netflix.Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s Competition Commissioner, has also flagged that the EC is poised to mount a separate inquiry covering geo-blocking of online content including TV programming and games.The arguments for and against are complex, but the founding principles of the European Union were designed to make Europe a single market.",
        "Indeed, hark back several decades to when the organisation was first established and it was known as the European Common Market.Many areas of European law already treat the market in that way: for example, all EC passport holders have the right of residency in any member country. Many, but not all, countries have signed up for Europe’s “single currency”, the Euro.",
        "Goods and services may be offered freely across all member states.When it comes to content, especially digital content, there are strong arguments for and against opening up the market. The major argument for creating a single market focuses on freedom of movement – a founding plank of a united Europe’s raison d’etre.",
        "If one buys (online access to) a digital service in one territory of the allegedly single market, one should not be geo-blocked from that service in other member states.Or, to quote Ansip: “I pay my taxes in Estonia so why, when in Brussels, can’t I watch content I bought legally?”Ansip used a specific example of not being able to watch football games, which won him plenty of public support for his position.",
        "Much of Europe is blocked from watching the world’s most popular league, England’s Premier League, access to which has already been the subject of European court cases.The challenge, from an industry perspective, is that while it might be relatively easy in practice to sell content or a subscription service into one region containing various member states, it’s a fast-track to chaos.The European Film Agency Directors (EFAD), which represents European film funds and other interested parties, has come out strongly against the proposals.",
        "EFAD argues that the territoriality principle must be preserved, because it’s the basis of much financing across Europe.The loudest voice opposing Ansip’s plans within the Commission so far has been Günther Oettinger, Commissioner for digital economy and society.",
        "Oettinger said that Europe needed to preserve its cultural diversity, and protect against serving only the interests of non-European consolidated entertainment content providers, or Hollywood.On challenge for creators is that not all content is supplied for sale. Many public broadcasters, the BBC being the prime example in Europe, raise income locally – via a licence fee in the BBC’s case.",
        "A change in legislation would mean all of Europe could access BBC programming directly (via its iPlayer service) for free, reducing the BBC’s ability to sell its programming to other European broadcasters.Why, the British public argues, should it pay for the BBC to create content which French, German, Italian viewers then get to watch for free?When it comes to films (and, to a lesser degree, high-end TV) the financing is increasingly multi-national in origin. Several challenges raise their heads here.",
        "National and regional funding bodies and incentive schemes provide cash on the basis of the ability to achieve some form of return.It’s already impossible, given Europe’s freedom of movement and labour laws, to require (let’s say) an Irish animation company working on an international co-production to employ Irish workers.When the potential return to an investor is a financial one, which is not always the case with some incentive-schemes and culturally-driven funding pots, sales of the finished product into different European territories helps achieve financial returns.The winners from the proposed changes would only be the biggest of players – those who operate across multiple territories, who are comfortable acquiring product for multiple territories using multiple languages.",
        "A few, such as Canal+, are European. Because only the biggest of players would play, the range of titles finding homes around Europe would diminish.It’s ironic given that the EC Vice President Ansip is proposing to cull territoriality in response to the dominance of American product over locally-produced fare in many European countries, when the major beneficiary of such a move would be the US studios.However, common sense is not a strong suit in Brussels. Commission Regulation No.",
        "1677/88 specifies that cucumbers will bend no more than 10mm per 10cm of length.For those looking to sell into European territories, at MipTV, MipCom or the Marché, there’s a risk – especially for deals spanning a number of years – that the goalposts will move and deals will need to be renegotiated or be declared void.There may be a reluctance from buyers to acquire product for a particular European territory, when they may later find themselves in dispute with buyers who holds rights for other areas of Europe.",
        "UK industry sources SCREENZ spoke to recently at FILMART expected to see a drop in business at MipTV in April and the Marché in May.Digital distributors into Europe are currently coming to terms with changes to business rules which now require distributors to pay GST-equivalent sales taxes in the country of residence of the buyer across Europe rather than in the territory of the seller.The change targets major vendors based outside of Europe, such as Amazon and iTunes, but applies to anybody selling digital goods into Europe.",
        "Rather than making one GST-equivalent filing per reporting period, sellers’ compliance costs now have to cover making up to 28 separate returns to different territories.The EC has announced that it will confirm further detail on its proposals around digital content in May, although not when in May."

The book hasn't yet arrived in my eager hands, but I logged on to check the publisher's website and found he's giving it away!",
        "Well, only two copies to people who email quickly and you can have a go on You might get a book before me, but I think my author's copies are going in the post as I blog.'How thrilling this must be for you,' my friends who don't write poetry are saying, and even some who do. It's only when that book is out there that it suddenly hits you that people will be reading it, which is fine, but also all those people you've mentioned in it.",
        "And, as poetry is often truthful and mentions real people, then the time of publication feels more like a good time to hide away. As Stevie Smith says at the start of her Novel on Yellow Notepaper, 'Oh my friends, my beautiful friends, who will never speak to me again.' I'm sure some of you will be able to find the correct wording for that! Goodbye friends, not to mention family. Still, a bit of solitude is nice at this time of the year.",

The over stimulation of living in another culture and losing touch with my mother tongue meant that I didn't write in those years, so when I came back to London I wrote with a focus I had never experienced before. An author I read about years ago said that becoming a mother made her take a step forward in her writing, and that happened for me too.",
        "As if all my physical deadlines had been met, as if becoming a mother made me somehow complete, I felt free to be alone and to write.My husband left and I wrote with a passion, going back over the years in Italy first, and then jumping backwards and forwards in time, getting out all those poems that were inside me somewhere waiting to be formed. Until, with the poem 'Never-Never Land', I caught up with the present and had come full circle, so it became the title poem.",
        "I'm working on a new collection now which is mainly set in the present, and just finishing a novel.If it all loses me friends I suppose I'll make new ones - the kind of people daring enough to hang around with poets who say 'publish and be damned'. At last I understand why some poets like to be cryptic, and why ambiguity might be our best friend. Why some people would rather write fiction not drawn from life. I think I'll carry on with a plain spoken style though.",

        "One of the best things about retirement is having the ability to travel and explore, and living in an assisted and independent living community doesn't change that fact. With that in mind, there are some things you should keep in mind to make traveling more safe and enjoyable.Pack all medications and have at least a week's worth of extra supplies. If you take medication that requires refrigeration take along an insulated bag and make sure all medications are in the labeled bottle they came in.",
        "For extended trips, you should also have written copies of all prescriptions just in case something is lost or stolen.Have a list of all medical conditions and physician contact information. This is a good place to also write all pertinent information such as times medications should be taken and who should be notified in case of emergency.If you're traveling by car plan for extra comfort stops so that you can stay comfortable. Plan on taking ten minute walks every hour to increase circulation.",
        "Make sure to bring neck pillows and other comforts to prevent stiff and soreness during the trip.Sometimes while traveling, it’s not always convenient to eat when you’re hungry (unless it’s a mostly food trip). Remember to always pack snacks to prevent exhausting your body from lack of nutrition.When planning overnight trips call ahead to the hotel and request an accessible room that is near the elevators or exits.",
        "This will help prevent exhaustion from going back and forth to the room.Traveling by air has a few perks if you are 75 or older. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) allows travelers expedited screening to ease the anxiety of the security check in. TSA also offers other screening procedures so that you are allowed to bring items you may need on you at all times. Contact your local airport to talk to them about any medical equipment you may need during your flight.",
        "For example, traveling with portable oxygen can be different depending on the airline so you need to know the policies in advance.Buses, trains, and cruise ships all have special accommodations for seniors who are part of a tour.",
        "Just make sure to call before you make reservations so you know the travel mode will be accessible and comfortable both during the trip and at the destination.With a bit of planning and a few phone calls you will find that traveling to a new place can be the adventure of a lifetime!"

Mom and I were late coming home from her Vitamin C treatment (I ended up on the NE extension of the turnpike by accident, not realizing it until we got to Quakertown). So I got to the gym around 5pm. By then, a lot of the high school athletes were there. Jason Coon was having a lousy day on the squat rack – he was doing jump-squats and dropped the bar – loaded with 225 lbs – and just about put a hole in the floor.",
        "Dane lectured him on staying in control. Jason went outside in the dark and in the dew and chucked sticks around the yard by the throwing circle, talking to himself all the while.Meanwhile I had a leg day. The cool thing about Dane’s routine is that I was warming up with what I normally would consider my workout – a few rounds of front squats and overhead squats with the bar, plus split squats.",
        "I started warming up for snatch with 25s on the bar, gradually moving up to 35s and I think getting about 120 or 130 for three or four reps, which is okay considering I have not done that move in years.Power cleans went better, and I maxed out at 175, more than my bodyweight, so a success in my mind. I felt good last night. I squatted as well, managing 225 for five before failing after one rep at 235. Again, it has been about five years since I did anything with that much weight on it, so not bad.",
        "The ‘warm down’ – again, what I would have considered a workout on its own – was kettlebell swings with the 80 pounder (mine is only 36), followed by pistol squats (one-leg, butt to the floor, no weight), and jumping lunges. Four sets of this just about did me in. My calf was shaking on the drive home trying to depress the clutch when I shifted gears.We ate the chicken soup I started making at Kate’s on Sunday.",
        "After picking the bones clean for dinner with Kevin and Kate on Friday night, I slow-cooked the bones in a crockpot for twelve hours or so. The next morning the rest of the meat fell off the bones into the soup, and I brought it home. It congealed into what Dane calls ‘chicken gelatin’ overnight in the fridge, and to get mom eating more I packed it full of rice, beans, carrots, spinach, half a stick of butter and some flour to thicken it.",
        "She managed to get down an entire bowl last night (plus half an avocado). The soup was excellent.I do not think I was fully recovered this morning. I went over at 8:30 for a cardio routine. I am playing golf tomorrow and do not want to be sore from lifting heavy (though I fear my legs will be anyway from yesterday, but that is manageable on the golf course. Sore arms less so).",
        "Dane had me doing circuits of kettlebell snatches with the 50 pounder (heavier than I have ever done), rope climb, pushups, the walrus (walking across the floor on one’s hands, feet propped up on a wheeled block of wood, in a pushup position), more pushups, box jumps, jumping lunges and pulling the prowler. I could not recover between sets for some reason, and had a headache all morning. My heart rate was through the roof and took far longer to come down than usual.",
        "I only did two circuits and left after collecting my computer (I was recording the ambient sound of the gym to play in the background during some of the interviews).Dane’s sister Kai (sp?) was there today working out. I have a time set tomorrow to chat with her about the farm and how her and Brant have helped out get the farm under way. She told me her five-year-old daughter works out once a week in the barn. “She has lats,” Kai said.I also chatted with another woman (name?) with breast cancer.",
        "She was interested in mom’s Vitamin C treatment, and attributes her quick recovery from surgery to Dane’s diet and exercise program she had been on. She is back in the gym, seemingly healthy, and starts chemo shortly.Both Dane and Dan were sporting new haircuts last night.",
        "Dane declared it is his last shave of the summer – he will let his beard rip from now on through the winter.I left the gym this morning with another chicken (Dane claims the broth should get my mom some of her strength back, even if it is the only thing she can get down), plus some mint chocolate he let me try, which is amazing. I brought a dozen eggs home last night, which I ate for brekky this morning.",
        "I still have about half a gallon of raw milk (in the midst of Kate’s party on Saturday, seven beers deep, I started offering people gulps of the stuff out of the jug. I think her friends thought I was a little off.",
        "I also made myself an Ezekiel English muffin which likely contributed to their opinions of me).Questions for Kai:- Whose idea was it to buy the farm?- What do you think of Brant mowing with your 18-month-old on his back?- How do you guys split the financing?- How much influence did Brooks have on this?- Tell me what you know about Brooks deal?- Who is Dane’s biggest influence? Brooks?- How close are the three of you to each other and your parents?",
        "How does that contribute to the success of you guys as a family?- How do you think Dane and Caitlin will raise Lincoln?- How often do you workout in the barn?- Do you and Brant have your own responsibilities beyond the farmhouse?- Tell me about the history of the farm and the house.- What do you do for a living? Brant? How do you guys reconcile that with the lifestyle your brothers are living?- How much influence does Joel Salatin have on Dane and/or Brooks?- I heard Brooks is presenting Food Inc.",

Of course, a lot of people think of Valentine’s Day too, but I’m an old married lady with grandchildren, so Christmas comes first. Real Red has a companion in Pink Pirouette, the Tint, but Pink Pirouette is definitely more Valentine’s than Christmas!",
        "Pink Pirouette makes cute Winter cards with snowflakes or even penguins and snowmen (I’ll show you in a few weeks), but Real Red is the rich, bright color of Christmas. It’s festive!I love Real Red paired with the Gold Foil Sheets. Silver Foil works as well, but I had the Gold Foil out. I really appreciate that Stampin’ Up!® put out the 1/8” Metallic Ribbon in both colors.",
        "Gold is, as I’ve mentioned before, a Neutral color, so the Monochromatic Color Scheme of Real Red and Gold works just fine!The Delicate Ornaments Thinlits™ Dies look fantastic in the Foil. I adore the lacy look. I had fun enhancing the laciness of this card with the Curvy Corner Trio Punch. The ornament could be made removable, but I tied the ribbon so it just dangles.",
        "If you want to make an ornament to hang up, do it simply by die-cutting two Red Foil solid ornament shapes and adhering them back to back, then adhere the lacy Gold ornament to one side. Use the Fine-Tip Glue Pen on the lace and work quickly because the glue dries fairly fast. The glue also dries shiny so it looks great on the Foil. By the way, the Red Foil Sheets are very close in color to Real Red, which is why I didn’t make an ornament from my card front decoration.",
        "I wanted the Card Stock to show through.Real Red Monochrome combinations are great for Christmas, Valentine’s Day, Red Hat Day, and other high-powered or festive occasions. Real Red with Basic Black, Early Espresso or Chocolate Chip gives a very sophisticated feel and is great for formal party and dinner invitations.

        "TIME spoke to Dan Fabricant, who recently became the head of the Natural Product Association (NPA) after serving as director of the dietary supplement programs at the FDA. Fabricant is no newbie to the NPA, though. Prior to leaving for the federal agency in 2011, Fabricant was president of global government and scientific affairs at the NPA.",
        "We asked him about making the switch between industry and regulator, leading a $32 billion industry, and skepticism over supplements.TIME: After three-plus years at the FDA, why did you want to go back to industry?Fabricant: I think we did more in my three and a half years there than had ever been done in dietary supplements, so I packed a career into a short time.",
        "I started to realize there is a lot I can do outside the agency to drive some of the issues I started to deal with inside in the agency, and that we can use the leverage we have to drive those initiatives. I enjoyed the work tremendously, and I am really proud of the work at the agency.",
        "This opportunity fell out of the sky, and it wasn’t without a lot of thought, but it’s an organization I really treasure.TIME: How do you think your experience at FDA influence your new position at the NPA?Fabricant: I think people look at the relationship between industry and regulator as an adversarial one. Not that it can’t be, but for our industry, the primary function is the same. It’s really about making sure the consumer has access to safe products.",
        "The thing we did particularly well when I was at the agency was tie it to public health. That’s big for us at NPA as well, and I think we are really going to have to drive the points home. There needs to be an understanding of why this is so important to the agency, and we need to make communications are crystal clear.",
        "In some ways I am lucky that I speak both languages on the industry and regulator side, which I think is becoming more and more important.TIME: What challenges are you facing as the natural product industry continues to grow?Fabricant: Culturally, there’s a shift, and there needs to be. The industry grew out of independent health care stores, and still has that independent spirit.",
        "At the same time, as things mature and we see natural products spread out to other market places, there may be misinformation or disinformation depending on who you ask. I think it’s about building a community across all chains of distribution throughout the supply chain and making sure everyone is on board with the concepts that got us to this going. The natural movement has gone more mainstream.",
        "You go into any store now and you see a lot of natural and organic products that you may not have seen 10-15 years ago. While everyone is excited about the growth in the marketplace, we also want to make sure that information is still out there to help consumers.TIME: What about all the incidences of products with unclaimed and undisclosed ingredients, and criticisms of poor regulation?",

        "Coming out of the FDA, you look at certain structure–and the bureaucracy takes awhile to change–but certain structures are not as appropriate as they used to be to get at the heart of those problems.One of the concerns we had while I was at the agency, and it is still a concern in the industry, are not supplements at all, but products masquerading as supplements. Tainted products that are typically found in three areas: sexual enhancement, body building, and weight loss.",
        "They contain active pharmaceutical ingredients and they are in effect, unapproved new drugs. [These manufacturers] use the supplement rubric as a mask to get at the marketplace. That taints the whole industry.One thing I got to know at the agency very well is the bandwidth at the FDA and the Dept. of Justice to bring to court those sorts of cases. This is what people are expecting of them.",
        "That’s part of our role—to make sure the agency is properly funded and also really adequately aligned with those interests. I don’t think that’s a tough sell.TIME: There’s also a lot of skepticism over whether Americans really need to be taking supplements at all. How do you respond to that?Fabricant: I think it’s interesting. I think physicians by and large only get on average about 16 hours worth of nutritional education in the medical school curriculum.",
        "Sixteen hours isn’t a lot, and I think less of that is dedicated to supplements and studies on supplements. I think it’s a community we really need to address, and make sure they understand the issues. One of the first things we tell anyone when they ask what we tell our retailers and manufacturers to advise consumers, is always talk to your doctor. But I think one of the things we need to do is make sure the docs are educated as well and really have a clear grasp of what’s what.",
        "A lot of people tend to have a strong opinion on dietary supplements on one way or the other. I think taking the emotion out of the topic and just looking at the science and is the place we would like to get things to.TIME: What supplements do you take on a daily basis?Fabricant: I take a multivitamin, I take fish oil, and I take a probiotic.TIME: People are very interested in probiotics. How do you determine what to take?Fabricant: There’s a lot out there.",
        "Talk to your physician and look at the research. I take it as general support for GI health and digestion, and I like the way mine tastes—it’s a liquid product. But if you go to clinicaltrials.gov there’s research on those sorts of products that support GI health. There’s a lot of information out there. They key question with any supplement use is why.",
        "When it comes to things like multivitamins, I take a multivitamin because I don’t necessarily always have the time to eat the best, so I want to make sure I am at least getting those things we know we need. It’s not so easy to get fatty fish in the diet, so I take fish oil.TIME: What are you looking forward to as the natural product industry continues to grow?Fabricant: The conversations. Getting people together who were not speaking as readily in the past.",
        "This industry has more in common than it does separate. I want to get people talking."

        "ThePlease Don’t LaughNext Chapter – Muzak in the ‘40sWilliam BentonAfter only five short years in existence, Muzak had amassed a music library of over 5,000 original recordings, larger than any other music entity or record label of the time. By the late ‘30s the company’s unique means of content distribution, telephonic multiplexing, had also gained wide-spread recognition. Muzak was ripe for growth and expansion.",
        "One of the most dynamic figures of the 20th century liked what he saw and had the money to grow Muzak’s business.Born in 1900, William Benton was an advertising prodigy and at the young age of 29 became co-founder of the New York ad agency Benton & Bowles, one of the biggest ad agencies in the US for 56 years. He moved to Connecticut in 1932 and served as vice president at the University of Chicago, then as state senator.",
        "For several decades he served on the board directors for Encyclopedia Britannica and was the main organizer behind “Voice of America.” Bill Benton was one of the country’s most respected and well known marketers, politicians, businessmen and socialites in the pre- and post-WWII years.With an eye on communication, education, business and serving the public Bill Benton purchased Muzak in 1939.",
        "He immediately set to work on building a business that would have made founder General George Squier, who died in 1934, very, very proud.Over the next several blogs (we’ll count after I’m finished), I plan to expose the impact this one man had on our business, our music and our country.",
        "The Muzak journey continues.Contributed by Bruce McKagan, Muzak Archives Director…And Now on to the ‘40s>>IMAGEIndustry’s First Recorded Music Program>>IMAGELittle Brother Crosby Makes His Mark>>IMAGEMusic to My Ears>>IMAGEThe Elevator Music Company?I’ve been digging through our historic archives over the past 4 years looking for any real reference to elevators. Sure, we’ve all learned about music’s role in soothing the nerves of those early elevator riders in the 1920s and ‘30s.",
        "But I have not found any internal documentation that links Muzak with providing that service in our initial days. Not that we didn’t, I just couldn’t find any evidence. I’ve located all kinds of information about our early efforts in building business in the fields of hospitality, restaurants, the workplace and factories, but no specific evidence tying us to the elevator business.",
        "I’ve looked through 1930s, ‘40s and ‘50s marketing material, board of director’s books, memos, you name it, but I have found nothing. Sure, people have written about it for years, but the evidence in our archives just isn’t there.So why does everybody know Muzak as the company that delivers “elevator music?”What I do know is that by the mid-1950s Muzak began to move away from recording popular artists laying down their own music.",
        "Instead we started recording studio musicians and orchestras playing Muzak arrangements of pop songs and standards played in an easy listening style. Mood music was extremely popular in the ‘50s and our research clearly demonstrated that soothing instrumentals, programmed in a certain fashion, would improve productivity and decrease absenteeism in the workplace. Over the next 3 decades our music staff dedicated themselves to the production of various styles of mood music.",
        "This soon became known to the public as “elevator music.” Whether heard in the workplace, a restaurant, at a hotel or in the elevator, the description became universal. Regardless if Muzak had produced it or not, by the mid-‘60s all mood music was “Muzak” and Muzak was the “elevator music” company.It’s been almost 30 years since we last recorded instrumental music.",
        "Since then we’ve licensed a vast library of almost 3 million tracks from all the music industry’s top major and indie artists. Muzak creates over 400 music programs for over 250,000 business locations, featuring every genre of music known to man. It’s been 30 years since you’ve heard “The Girl from Ipanema” by the Muzak Orchestra playing at your local restaurant.But the elevator lives on … and so does Muzak.",
        "Over the last 24 hours alone there were over 2,000 mentions of Muzak in the media, with 1,500 of those referring to “elevator music”. Someone once said that there is no such thing as bad press.So, how about one of those campy 1950s treasures right now? This baby hasn’t been heard in over 30 years.14th floor please!Contributed by Bruce McKagan, Muzak Archives DirectorMore Dorsey Studio TimeOl’ Man River"

        "While still several months away – remember, the NBA Playoffs take FOREVER – I feel it’s time to return to the issue.No smarter idea than to target the exact players I spoke about before.",

        "Averaging 25 points and 12 rebounds per game, Beasley has already delivered a win against in-state rival Kansas and has the Wildcats ranked and tourney-dangerous.Will he go?: There is not a doubt in my mind, regardless of what does or doesn’t happen in March Madness or a team’s particular need for a point guard. Beasley is NBA-bound and the 1st overall pick.",
        "Signed, sealed and delivered.Destination: He could go to a surprising once-contender (Derrick Rose [PG, Memphis]Analysis: If Beasley is the consensus #1 overall pick, Rose – my pre-season pick for freshman of the year - has earned the right to be considered 1B (thus, the second pick).",
        "The 6’4” point guard has stepped into a starting role from day one at Memphis and has anchored the team to a 22-0 record and the overall #1 ranking.Will he go?: Despite his numbers being far from eye-popping (14 pts, 4 ast, 32% 3pt), Rose is obviously NBA-bound. With plenty of size, strength and shooting ability, he knows that even in an uber-talented draft class, he’s the point guard of choice right now.Destination: Tons of teams need point guards for the future.",
        "Kevin Durant would benefit tremendously from Rose’s ability to get to the bucket and dish out to the wing for an open shot. Of course, the same can be said for countless other lottery-bound teams.OJ Mayo [PG, USC]Analysis: The most egomaniacal collegiate player perhaps since the days of Chris Webber, Mayo has plenty of controversy surrounding him. While USC may be underachieving, Mayo’s talent potential could net him in the top 3.",
        "However, his attitude may overcome his on-court ability and allow him to slide deeper into the lottery than even he might expect.Will he go?: Mayo would’ve loved to come out this past draft, likely netting himself easy top-5 consideration. While holes in his game exist, he’s also shown flashes of pure brilliance at SC. He’s definitely coming out, but his attitude may shave the initial millions.Destination: Several mocks have struggled to place Mayo in the right situation.",
        "Rather than basing his selection purely on talent, team chemistry and even potential media opportunities may matter when considering Mayo. A likely combo-guard, it’d be quite interesting to see what a team later in the lottery (i.e. Chicago, Indiana and Milwaukee) might do if Mayo is still on the board when they select.Donte Greene [PF,Analysis: At 6’11”, he reminds me far too much of former Villanova product Tim Thomas.",
        "His shot is nearly unblockable on the wing; however, he lacks any real strength or presence in the post. Unable to draw fouls at any sort of consistent rate, Green is still 2-3 years away from truly realizing his role on the court and overall potential.Will he go?: It appears likely that Greene is leavingDestination: Greene isn’t going to make an instant impact on your roster. However, at 6’11”, he can shoot lights out from behind the arc and may still develop a reasonably effective inside game.",
        "Teams in need of size and shooting (Clippers, Bucks and Grizzlies) will take a long hard look at Greene and some of the combo guards available.Eric Gordon [PG/SG,Analysis: Potentially under the radar a bit during the pre-season hype engulfing Beasley/Rose/Mayo, don’t sleep on the incredible athleticism and overall playmaking ability of Gordon. He plays every inch of his 6’4” frame and has zero problem getting into the lane quickly and wreaking havoc on defenders.",
        "As good a 1-on-1 player in college basketball this season, several teams wouldn’t mind handling over their playmaking duties to the phenom Gordon.Will he go?: Despite his desire to be a Hoosier, Gordon is a sure-fire top 5 pick in the upcoming draft. Likely ahead for good of Mayo, this year’s crop of the two top point-guards (Rose/Gordon) may go the way of another duo (Paul/Williams).Destination: Several teams need point guards and will have plenty of opportunities to swipe one in the upcoming draft.",
        "If Beasley is gone for Seattle, it seems impossible they’d pass on one of the two top poing guards. D-Wade and Marion wouldn’t mind having this kid in the backcourt either. In fact, nobody would.DeAndre Jordan [C,Analysis: Loved by countless draft sites throughout the year, it’s rare that someone 7’0”, 250 lbs. and so physically polished wouldn’t be given more national attention. Jordan has the frame to play in the middle in the NBA.",
        "While comparisons to Dwight Howard are premature, the Houston native has an incredible combination of size, leaping ability, and can run the floor extremely well.",
        "Quite the trio for a potential foundation at the center position for the next ten years.Will he go?: Not a slam dunk to leave, I find it hard to believeDestination: If he comes out, several teams will clamor for the opportunity to pass up the flashiness of a 19-year old point guard and instead establish their future in a potentially dominant big man (let’s call it the Bynum-factor).",
        "From coast to coast (Knicks to 76ers to Sonics), a true center is something several teams can’t afford to pass up.There are several other names of note I couldn’t get into today.However, it’d be a mistake to sleep on names like UCLA’s Kevin Love (Spencer Hawes will hurt him unfortunately), Blake Griffin of Oklahoma, and Jerryd Bayless (Arizona).Next up: A pick-six collection of international talent."

The Austin Business Journal featured that data in its own analysis noting, however, that prices and velocity are starting to slip.Austin isn't alone in Trulia's latest report, which estimates that seven of the largest 100 metro markets are overvalued in excess of 10 percent — the highest since the first quarter of 2009.",

Gray nipped between the goalkeeper and defender to stroke the ball home from just outside the area. Southampton eventually went on to win the game in a penalty shoot-out after scores were level 2–2 after extra time.",
        "This was the first ever such shoot-out involving First Division sides.Following the departure of Dave Jones from Sheffield Wednesday at the end of November 2013 Gray took over as caretaker manager with a view to taking on the managerial role permanently, and as of 8 February had led Wednesday to a run of 11 unbeaten games in all competitions.In his one full season in charge of the club, he secured their highest finish for 6 years, finishing 13th in a Championship campaign that also saw Wednesday equal their clean sheet record for a season.In December 2012, Gray was hired by his former Southampton colleague, Dave Jones, as a member of the coaching staff at Championship club Sheffield Wednesday.On 19 January 2010 Gray became the first-team coach for Burnley.",

        "Early results were poor and chairman Rupert Lowe panicked about the effect on the club's investment in the new stadium and Gray was sacked after little more than 3 months in charge, to be replaced by Gordon Strachan. During his brief tenure as manager, he broke Southampton's transfer record, signing Rory Delap for a fee of £4 million.After his playing career was finished, Gray joined the coaching staff at The Dell before moving to Wolverhampton Wanderers in June 1994 as reserve team coach.",
        "His family were unable to settle in the West Midlands at this time, so he returned to Southampton, initially working in the community office, before becoming reserve team coach under Dave Jones in July 1997, moving up to first team coach in November 1998, a role he retained after the appointment of Glenn Hoddle as manager in January 2000.Gray joined Southampton in September 1991 for a fee of £200,000 as one of Ian Branfoot's first signings.",
        "Initially, this appeared to be a useful signing for the club as he could play either at left-back as cover for Micky Adams or in midfield, but a serious Achilles tendon injury sustained in an FA Cup match against former club Bolton Wanderers ended his playing career.Born in Withernsea, East Riding of Yorkshire, Gray began his professional career with Nottingham Forest, emerging from the youth system with players such as Steve Hodge and Colin Walsh.",

Everything that you will read here is entirely based on my own first-hand experience, unless otherwise stated.",
        "I will also be reposting my old travel-related articles from my now-defunct personal blog which I created way back in 2007. So my posts will not be arranged in chronological order in terms of the travel date, but I will be creating several categories to organize the content.Although this blog primarily aims to inspire my readers from the Philippines to get out of their comfort zone through traveling, I will try to write stuff that will speak to an international audience.",
        "Hopefully, you will find the content posted here helpful in planning your future travels.I promise myself to update this blog regularly and I plan to keep the promise of being prolific than ever before. Feel free to follow my blog and share your own travel experiences by commenting in my posts.Thank you for stopping by! Cheers!-Sherwin"

        "Posts Tagged ‘plains of abraham’From the Plains of Abraham to Abraham LincolnThere are two schools of thought in Québec when it comes to the historical significance of the British conquest of 1759. The so-called Montréal school of thinkers consider it was a historical, economic and social tragedy that stunted the development of French-canadian culture and society.",
        "According to the Québec school of thought it spared Québec from the chaos and violence of the French Revolution and gave it access to British government and democracy.I’m more partial to the second school’s interpretation.",
        "The conquest did result in two centuries of rule by a lunatic papist theocracy propped up by a cotery of racist British robber-barons, but at the end of the day, we’re still here, we’re still speaking French and we can only imagine how much bloodier things would’ve been if New France had been conquered by the Spaniards or the Dutch.The conquest was a thing. It happened.",
        "What are you gonna do about it?We’ll I know at least one thing I wouldn’t do about it is celebrate it.Yet, that’s exactly what Québec City is getting ready to do.The National Battlefields Commission is organizing a full-scale re-enactment of both the battle and the siege of Québec this summer to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the British Conquest of New France.I get it. The whole thing is historically-minded. There’s going to be conferences by scholars.",
        "The website says they are ‘marking’ the anniversary, not having a party. The poster for the event shows two smiling generals shaking hands and the program includes a comedy cabaret with Wolfe and Montcalm impersonators.Yet you have to be seriously clueless to think that a full-scale re-enactment of the mother of all of Québec’s many historical traumas and unresolved ‘issues’ is going to go down without drama. Come on!",
        "It was only a few months ago that some people nearly lost it because Paul McCartney went on the Plains to sing in English!The Réseau de Résistance des Québécois and filmmaker Pierre Falardeau have already given the organisers an ultimatum: “This is why the Réseau de Résistance du Québécois (RRQ) is as of now on the war path, to be ready to get into action on the 15th of February if the said commission does not back down by then and announce the cancellation of the event.”I can already imagine the the battalion of Jeunes Patriotes with flags and gaz masks charging the middle aged suburban Americans in tights playing the role of the british troops.",
        "Maybe Amir Khadir will attack the Wolfe impersonator with his shoes.This said, I do think they have a point. The Conquest is a very emotional and significant historical event. In the country with the Occident’s strongest and best organized secessionist movement, you’d think people would take that into consideration.Compare this to the emotionally charged and masterfully played lead up to Barack Obama’s inauguration.",
        "This week we saw the president-elect re-enact the train trip Abraham Lincoln took to Washington on the eve of the Civil War and a massive concert was held in front of the Lincoln monument where Martin Luther King gave the most famous american speech ever. All of this evokes slavery, civil war and segregation, but in the context of the the first black president’s swearing in, America is actually creating a brand new historical moment.",
        "A moment of reconciliation.Over here the Canadian government thinks it can defuse the memory of the Conquest by treating it like the emotional equivalent of the war of the Peloponese and turning it into a vaudeville. This is the opposite of what the Americans are doing. This is trivializing the past. It is disrespecting the many Québécois who still have the memory of the consequences of the Conquest stuck in their throats.Next year: the re-enactment of the American Indian genocide!"

        "Jose de Ribera - Ladies Duel (Women's Duel). 235 x 212 cmThis picture has an original and very interesting story. It was written as part of a cycle of more than thirty paintings on the history of Rome. Fulfilled the order of several artists, including de Ribera.The canvas is written on an event that really happened. In 1552, two wealthy and noble Neapolitan ladies sorted out relations among themselves in a real duel. The reason for such an extraordinary event was the love of the local gentleman.",
        "He watched the passage of the \"battle\" of the Marquis of DaValos, a famous aristocrat.The image in the picture, despite the real background of the event, is allegorical. Many scholars interpret the plot as a duel between virtue and vice.The composition is built as a battle of two Roman gladiators in a female form. In the background you can see a rather high board fence separating the audience from the arena. Behind her is a group of men in antique outfits and military uniforms.",
        "They are armed - long spears and halberds rise above the crowd. The \"mass\" is depicted in dark, brownish tones for a more contrasting selection of figures in the foreground.The backdrop of the picture is a blurred image of the landscape with Vesuvius in the background and architectural elements.",
        "Both the building and the mountain are drowning in a light bluish-gray haze, only the sky in the distance is slightly golden from sunlight.The foreground of the canvas is an image of two battling women in complex, somewhat mannered poses. This is typical for Baroque painting, as well as the use of rich colors and spectacular draperies with large, beautiful folds.One of the women fell under the pressure of the enemy, hiding behind a small shield worn on her hand.",
        "In her other hand, she has a long, thin sword, more like a rapier. This is a clear borrowing from the contemporary artist of the era - in Roman times they used a short wide sword - the gladius. This figure personifies the vice afflicted by Virtue.The second female figure is depicted in a punitive pose. A sword is placed above the head of the defeated Vice, a round, convex shield covers the body.",
        "Unlike the figure of a fallen woman, executed in restrained and rather dark colors, Virtue is decorated with a golden yellow tunic, assembled in a beautiful drapery.The canvas impresses with its expression and original plot, as well as the high level of the artist’s pictorial skill. It occupies a worthy place in the exposition of the Prado Museum."

        "Discuss 'YOUTH HOLD OFF THE CITIZENS AT THE BRIDGE' on our ForumsA hugely entertaining first leg of the FA Youth Cup Final saw Chelsea come from behind for the third straight game in the competition to earn a much deserved draw that leaves them with a chance of lifting the trophy at the City of Manchester Stadium in a fortnight’s time.",
        "On the balance of play the home team, backed by a crowd of just under 12,000, would have deserved to take a lead to Manchester and make their chances even better, but it wasn’t to be and there is still work ahead.Paul Clement caused few surprises with his line-up choice, preferring Jacob Mellis in central midfield to Frank Nouble on the wing, meaning Gael Kakuta was pushed wide to accommodate the former Sheffield United youngster.",
        "Man City were missing Slovakian goalkeeper Filip Mentel but had Daniel Sturridge up front, a player with two senior professional goals to his name in 2008.The visitors started brightly, Sturridge proving his credentials inside the opening five minutes by first making van Aanholt look silly in the corner and then providing Rhys Taylor an early chance for a save with a tame left foot shot from the edge of the area.",
        "At the other end, Chelsea’s star player was causing problems, as Kakuta twice unleashed long range efforts, with his range slightly off.The first notable chance fell to the City captain Ben Mee after 20 minutes. Weiss’ corner found the head of the skipper, but Taylor showed fantastic agility to tip the ball wide of the post whilst diving backwards. It was a save worthy of the very highest stage and kept Chelsea in the game at a crucial time.",
        "Minutes later, Chelsea had the ball in the net, but referee Peter Walton and his linesman combined to chalk it off. Morten Nielsen brought a ball into possession well and got around Mee before lobbing the advancing Greg Hartley. Walton however had decided that the Dane had deliberately used his hand to settle the ball, and booked him for the indiscretion.Just before the half hour mark Nielsen went close legally, shifting the ball around on the edge of the area but dragged his shot wide.",
        "The Chelsea pressure was rising and they went even closer five minutes later, as a short free kick routine saw Woods cut the ball back for Tejera 8 yards out. His first-time shot on the turn hit the top of the near post and bounced to safety.",
        "The Spaniard was then denied a goal for the second time in three minutes as he diverted Mellis’ pass into the net, but was a yard offside and this time there were no arguments about the disallowed goal.For all Chelsea’s first half dominance and chances, the two were to go into the Stamford Bridge dressing rooms level at half time with the scoresheet blank.",
        "It didn’t remain that way for long after the restart, City needing just four minutes to change that.Chelsea gave possession away too easily, Mellis looking to take a deep free kick too quickly and wasting the ball. Weiss picked it up at halfway and drove deep into the middle of the Chelsea line.",
        "His pass released Sturridge inside the left channel and from 8 yards out he coolly finished past Taylor, showing his class and advanced ability to give his team a lead they didn’t deserve, but had.It led to a dominant spell for the visitors, a spell in which they should have added a second goal. Weiss hooked a shot woefully wide when he should have at least hit the target, then after Mellis had a chance but fell over, David Ball wasted a gilt-edged chance to give City an almost unassailable lead.",
        "Chelsea were pushing up, but allowing Sturridge’s pace to worry them on the break. Patrick van Aanholt largely dealt with him exceptionally all night, and on this occasion he was missing, as Weiss broke and cut the ball back to Ball, ten yards out and entirely unmarked.",
        "Taylor dived low, the shot went high, and into the empty seats in the Upper Tier of the Shed End.Adam Phillip was sent on as the regular FA Youth Cup super-sub and started to show his game-changing ability with his dynamic running and link-up play. With 25 minutes left, Chelsea levelled deservedly, with the goal coming from the star of the season.",
        "Stoch’s corner tempted Hartley into coming, but Kakuta’s run got to the ball first, and the little man’s header crashed in off the crossbar.As with the first goal, the confidence flowed from the team who had just scored, as Stoch forced a save before Tejera placed an 18 yard shot just wide. A loud and energetic crowd covering all four stands were willing the youngsters on, and the big chance came with ten minutes left.",
        "Phillip again was involved, running to the edge of the box before sliding Kakuta in. He took a left footed shot first time, with the angle slightly against him, and could only see the shot fly high over the goal. The French wizard was to have one more moment, carrying the ball through midfield with options right and left but choosing to shoot from the edge of the area.",
        "The ball was destined for the bottom corner until the very last second, where it swerved inches wide of the post.So, Chelsea will go into the second leg again with a 1-1 home scoreline, and work to do. Their performance was entirely worthy of a win, and saw top performances from Taylor, Woods, Mellis and Kakuta, but in particular van Aanholt.",
        "As the most experience of the four defenders he took on a responsibility to deal with the troublesome Sturridge and after a shaky start was excellent in nullifying the most dangerous attacking outlet on the field.More photos from the game can be found on Dan Davies’s web siteTeam: Taylor, Ofori-Twumasi ©, Bruma, van Aanholt, Gordon, Woods, Tejera, Mellis, Stoch, Kakuta, Nielsen (Phillip 61)Goals: Kakuta 66Booked: Nielsen, Mellis"

        "Maybe I shouldn't blame this on being pregnant, but maybe its the increase of hormones is just causing an influx of klutziness.Last Monday I was carrying 5 hard cider bottles out of the cooler (and don't worry I was not drinking any of them, sadly) I had too many in my hand, and I dropped one, spilling sticky hard cider all over the place.Last Tuesday when making pies, I burned my arm, I guess when I was taking the pie out of the over, I hit my arm on the inside of the hot oven, and left a lovely burn mark on my arm.Last Wednesday, when putting the dirty dished away, I had two our of dinner serving dishes in my hand at the same time, clung them together, and broken one.Last Friday, in the middle of the night when going to the bathroom, and then I went back to bed, because it was dark and I was half asleep, I walked right into the bedpost, ramming my thigh in it, leaving a lovely giant bruise on it.Last Saturday, when mopping the kitchen floor, I had the mop in the bucket, I moved the bucket, and the mop became top-heavy, and fell over knocking the entire contents of water all over the floor.",

        "So I had two watery messes to clean up, and thank God the water didn't leak a few inches closer to all over Matt's electrical wires and electronic equipment.Yesterday, I was making lunch at work, I had a hot frozen meal that I took out of the microwave, I opened the vent up to stir it, and don't ask me how, but somehow I manage to fling half of the contents of my frozen meal on to the floor, and on my hand, and the scorching hot gravy left a wonderful burn spot on my hand.And today, literally just an half hour ago, I had Matt's glass he got from prom one year, he had coins in it.",
        "I took the glass with me to work, to put the coins in a penny competition we are having at work, and tonight I took the empty glass back out of my car. A smart person would have put all the coins in a bag and not even bring the glass along, but unfortunately I do not think smart like that. So when I went to grab the glass, I also grabbed my pie plate I had in the car, I put the pie plate on top of the glass, because I had too much in my hand, and of course I break Matt's prom glass. Good job me!",
        "Matt's not too happy with me right now, with my streak of destruction, which I can't blame him. :(Maybe I shouldn't blame the increase of hormones, but maybe the increase of pregnancy brain, making me more flighty and just not thinking in the best way, and hence doing way more stupider things. Sigh. I'm getting worry about this destruction streak I've been having in the last week.",
        "I really hope it goes away, for the sake of my baby and my husband's sanity.Knock on wood, I really really REALLY hope I don't break anything else this week or hurt myself in any way. I don't think I can go on for another 23 weeks of breaking things and ruining things.."

        "If it is sinful to look at their website, why is it not sinful to look at a hard copy of the Bible, their magazine etc.Seems odd to me.Is there a member of the FPCS out there who could explain the logic.Colin,This is unfortunate. Lately I’ve been rereading Paul’s Letters and Galatians 5:1 is in play here: “It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery” (NIV)."

I'm supposed to be honest right?Yup.Drugs...In my opinion, prescription drugs are being prescribed too freely in the entertainment business.. people shop doctors too much and are just being abused. Whether it's Oxycontin, Xanax or plenty of others... they are addicting.",

Remember the scene from Cheech and Chong's Up In Smoke\"?A study in the United State shows that drug use kills more people than traffic accidents.In my opinion, cannabis should be made available to all cancer patients... dang... you want honesty right?

It is a fact that cigarette smoking kills about 6 million people {and rising} worldwide each year. This is just so crazy!

Heck! They're too stone to get off the couch! {and} if they were to get off the couch it would be to head directly to the fridge and or pantry! wink, wink.It is reported that there are 2.5 million deaths worldwide related to alcohol.I am not saying that I do not drink...

        "I am saying that some people have more of an addicting personality that others and should not drink.Where do you draw the line?I could go on and on on this matter but I think this gives you an idea of what my views are on drugs and alcohol.What do YOU think?\"Annual drug deaths: tobacco: 395,000, alcohol: 125,000, 'legal' drugs: 38,000, illegal drug overdoses: 5,200, marijuana: 0.

I've never smoked pot, but know a lot of people who have.",

        "More than a third of Americans have debts reported to collection agencies. If you're one of them, here are the repayment and negotiating strategies you need to know.Today’s encouraging economic news notwithstanding, plenty of Americans are still struggling with their own personal economies. According to a study released Tuesday by the Urban Institute, more than 35% of Americans have debt that has been reported to collection agencies.",
        "What’s more, the share of consumers in collections hasn’t changed, even as overall credit-card debt has decreased in recent years..1. Don’t Get EmotionalWhen a debt collector calls, he’s trying to assess your ability to pay and may attempt to get you to say or agree to things you shouldn’t. You’d be best served by keeping the initial call short and businesslike. Collection agencies are required by law to send you a written notice of how much you owe five days after initially contacting you.",
        "Wait to engage with them until after you receive this letter.2. Make Sure the Debt Is Really YoursIf the debt sounds unfamiliar, check your credit reports. Request a report from each of the three credit bureaus for free from annualcreditreport.com and scan for any incorrect data. A study by the Federal Trade Commission found that one in 20 consumers could have errors in their reports, and 24% of the mistakes people reported were about a debt collection that wasn’t actually theirs.",
        "(Learn more about how to fix costly credit report errors.)3. Ask for ProofOnce you get written notice, contact the debt collector. If you are disputing the debt because of an error or identity theft, send a letter to the collector by certified mail within 30 days of receiving your notice stating that you will not pay and why. Also notify each of the three credit bureaus by mail, explaining the error and including documentation so that the problem can be removed from your report.",
        "If you are unsure about whether you owe money or how much you owe, ask the collector by certified mail for verification of the debt. That should silence the calls for a while; collectors must suspend activity until they’ve sent you verification of the debt.4. Resist the Scare TacticsSome debt collectors may try a range of tricks to get you to pay up, but it’s important to know your rights.",
        "Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, collectors cannot use abusive or obscene language, harass you with repeated calls, call before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., call you at work if you’ve asked them to stop, talk to a third party about your debt, claim to be an attorney or law enforcement, threaten to sue unless they intend to take legal action, or threaten to garnish wages or seize property unless they actually intend to.",
        "If the agency commits a violation, file a complaint with the FTC and your state Attorney General, and consider talking to an attorney about bringing your own private action against the collector for breaking the law.5. Be Wary of FeesTypically, the contract you agreed to when you took out the loan or signed up for the line of credit states how much interest a collector can charge on your debt. Most states have laws in place capping the amount of interest agencies can tack on.",
        "Check the balance the original creditor listed as “charged off” on your credit report. If there is a big increase in the amount the collector wants, consult your original contract. Your verification letter may also give you more info about how fees are calculated. If you believe the debt has been inflated, reach out to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which might be able to resolve your issue with the collector.6.",
        "NegotiateCollection agencies will push you to pay the full debt at once, but if that is not an option for you, tell them how much you can afford to pay and ask if they will settle for that amount. If they accept these terms, get confirmation of the deal in writing before you pay. This way, you avoid any miscommunication about the total to be paid and time frame for the payments.7.",
        "Call In BackupIf you and the debt collector can’t reach an agreement and it appears likely they will take you to court, consider hiring an attorney. While the fees and costs of doing so may be prohibitive, the collection agency is more likely to drop the case in favor of easier targets, a.k.a debtors without attorney representation.8.",
        "Know the Time LimitsCreditors may imply that court action can be taken against if you don’t pay up, and while that’s true, there is only a certain window of time—typically three to six years—in which a creditor can sue you over the debt. While you’ll still owe the money, and collectors may still call about it, creditors cannot take you to court over it once it’s past your state’s statute of limitations.",
        "Statutes vary widely by state and type of debt, so check your state’s specific rules if the collector is calling about older debts.9.",
        "Don’t Get Tripped Up By Your Own Good IntentionsCollectors can’t legally “re-age” your debt by giving it a new delinquency date, but you can inadvertently extend the statute of limitations or restart the clock in some states by making a payment on old debt, agreeing to an extended repayment plan, or even acknowledging that the debts is yours.More Help for Conquering Debt:3 Simple Steps to Get Out of Debt7 Ways to Improve Your CreditWhich Debts Should I Pay Off First?"

        "SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF STATE STREET—A startling discovery was made last Wednesday when professors from the department of archaeological anthropology uncovered what they believe to be the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology. The doors of the museum were unsealed Thursday morning for what may be the first time in modern history, sources say.“It’s a remarkable discovery, and it’s been right next to the LSA building this whole time!” said Professor Patrick Wright.",
        "“It appears that no one has entered or left the museum in ages.”Artifacts uncovered on site include several fine specimens of Greek and Roman masonry, a collection of Egyptian sarcophagi, and the preserved corpse of the museum desk clerk. “We’ve been given a really fascinating look into the lives of the people of this museum.",
        "For example, the desk clerk, in a sacrifice analogous to the servants of Pharaohs being imprisoned beneath the pyramids, remained completely alone for hours waiting for people to visit.”Most of Wright’s contemporaries agree this find can help us understand more about the Kelsey Museum and the behavior patterns of its patrons.“It appears to be some kind of shrine, a temple of sorts, to an order known as the archaeologist,” continued Wright.",
        "“It tells us a lot about the culture and time period this particular site is from. It would seem that because of some strange, misplaced nostalgia, these archaeologists collected all sorts of fragments from long dead civilizations, with rituals that included months of laborious digging, often uncovering nothing but pottery shards.",
        "And even before these archaeologists could do that, they spent years locked indoors, in a celibate order known as graduate school learning all they could about trivial, esoteric details of insignificant and far flung cultures, looking for some kind of meaning, some shred of beauty, to apply to the chaotic and unsentimental world they found themselves in.”“What would drive them to preserve antiquity while their youth drained away, and the world flew by, leaving them unnoticed and unappreciated?",
        "What could the cold remnants of lives gone by offer those sad, lifeless intellectuals?",
        "Where is the adventure?” Wright continues, “Where are the untouched corners of the world, the golden idols, that I was promised?”Shortly following the museum’s uncovering, another member of the archaeological team reported having seen Wright flee the excavation site, mumbling something unintelligible about focusing on his marriage, making amends with his dying father, and traveling to Cabo San Lucas.Originally Published Feb 2014"

        "Hall of Fame honors Post-Gazette Steelers reporter Ed BouchetteAugust 3, 2014 12:40 AMCANTON, Ohio -- The first indication it was going to be a special weekend for Ed Bouchette came when he was assigned a driver to take him wherever he wanted to go for three days during the Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinement festivities.But there was no destination he enjoyed being chauffeured to more than Fawcett Stadium, where he shared the stage and a bit of the spotlight Saturday night with the Class of 2014 and some of the players he helped vote into the Hall of Fame.Bouchette, who has covered the Steelers for 30 years for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, received the Dick McCann Award at the beginning of the enshrinement ceremonies, getting a few \"boos\" from some of the gold-jacketed Hall of Famers on stage, including the former Steelers great whose jersey was recently retired -- Joe Greene.\"I think they were doing that for my last name,\" Bouchette said.",
        "\"At least I think so.\"The McCann Award is voted on by members of the Pro Football Writers Association of America and given to a writer for long and distinguished reporting on professional football.",
        "It is named in honor of McCann, who was the first director of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.The list of McCann honorees -- 45 in all since 1969 -- is sometimes referred to as the \"writer's wing\" of the Hall of Fame, even though there is no actual area.But Bouchette said he felt like a Hall of Famer after the way he was treated during the three days of festivities.\"The whole weekend was great, they treated me great. They went out of their way to make it a nice weekend.",
        "It culminated with Dave Baker presenting me with the award,\" Bouchette said, referring to the Hall of Fame president and executive director.He added: \"It's a little humbling, the whole thing. When you see all the names on that list, it was nice to be on it.\"Bouchette is the second writer from a Pittsburgh newspaper to receive the McCann Award, joining Pat Livingston of The Pittsburgh Press, who was honored in 1979.",
        "Two other sports writers who formerly worked in Pittsburgh -- Vito Stellino (1989) and John Clayton (2007) -- received the award after they left their respective papers.\"Post-Gazette readers didn't need a Hall of Fame to tell them that they had a special correspondent in Ed Bouchette,\" said Post-Gazette executive editor David Shribman, who attended the induction ceremonies and visited with Bouchette and his family before he received the award.",
        "\"But it's always special to have a correspondent like Ed recognized by the Hall of Fame.\"Greene, Mel Blount, Lynn Swann and Dermontti Dawson were among the former Steelers and Hall of Famers who were on stage when Bouchette was presented his award.",
        "They were also a few of the many players he has covered in his 30 years on the Steelers beat for the Post-Gazette.But Bouchette didn't just cover those players; he has been a selector for the Hall of Fame for 20 years and helped several of them get elected.\"I talked to Joe backstage and he congratulated me,\" Bouchette said. \"I saw Dan Rooney the other night at the dinner and I got to see Dermontti.",
        "It was a wonderful weekend.\".Before he was introduced to the crowd at Fawcett Stadium, a video of Bouchette played on the giant video screens on each side of the stage.",
        "During the video, Bouchette said the favorite of the 30 Super Bowls he has covered in his career came in February 2009, when the Steelers beat the Arizona Cardinals on Ben Roethlisberger's throw and Santonio Holmes' acrobatic catch in the corner of the end zone in the final seconds.One of his most memorable professional moments came in 1991 when he covered the final news conference of the late Chuck Noll, who announced he was retiring as head coach.Toward the end of the news conference, Noll said the lasting lesson he wanted to impart was, \"Don't leave anything on the beach but footprints.\" Bouchette used that quote to set up his ending in the story he wrote for the Post-Gazette.\"He walked briskly down the hall, pulling on his black overcoat,\" Bouchette said on the video, recalling the words he wrote.",
        "\"He never glanced at the four Super Bowl trophies as he walked out the door.\"Those are Chuck Noll's footprints.\"Gerry Dulac: gdulac@post-gazette.com; Twitter @gerrydulac."

        "Peter Weller, who we learned this year will be featured in the next Star Trek movie, originally dawned the steel armor of the downed cop who, like the Bionic Man, was rebuilt to fight the forces of evil in the U.S.",
        "The original costume is instantly recognizable, but early word from production is that we will see a very different police armor uniform for the new RoboCop.Although it is not quite as cool as the original RoboCop, I am a fan of the Iowa State Patrol uniform worn by the officer hunting down a young James T.",

These guys looked believable.",

So it should be no surprise if the new RoboCop takes no design queues from Verhoeven’s RoboCop.",
        "Verhoeven’s RoboCop was inspired by the future cop from the comic book 2000 A.D., Judge Dredd, and Verhoeven’s RoboCop has been interpreted as a retelling of sorts of the original Judge Dredd story because of several common themes, and, of course, the mask. Although the Sylvester Stallone future cop in Judge Dredd didn’t adhere totally to the original story, he did have a mask, but his uniform was a bit strange:Future cops are definitely “in” these days.",

        "Dick’s short story of the same name:For the new RoboCop, José Padilha is slated to direct a screenplay by Nick Schenk and Joshua Zetumer. Thirty-three year old actor Joel Kinnaman has been tapped for the lead role as Murphy/RoboCop. Of the creative trio, Schenk is the best known for his sceenplay for Clint Eastwood’s (awesome) film, Gran Torino.",
        "Kinnaman had a small role in last year’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and as Stephen Holder in the TV series, The Killing.Here is the the marketing blurb for the new film: “In a crime-ridden city, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg with submerged memories haunting him.”Padilha and Kinnaman have disclosed thus far that the new RoboCop will be a very different film than the original, with a costume where you can see the RoboCop’s eyes, and they’d said that the focus of the new story will be the period from Murphy getting shot to becoming RoboCop, as opposed to an action film where RoboCop serves as a futuristic officer.",
        "So this seems a bit like the path of Martin Caidin’s original Bionic Man story as told in his novel Cyborg.My favorite scene, and the one I hope they do include in some way, is the scene where the non-cyborg RoboCop before Weller’s is revealed to be flawed and destroys one of the executives in the board room at the big reveal.The current release date is scheduled for August 9, 2013.C.J.

        "It is a little time consuming, but it is worth the extra effort that it takes!Ingredients:- Chicken Breast - 1 pound- Large Eggs - 4- All Purpose Flour - 2 cups- Salt - 1 tablespoon- Black Pepper - 2 tablespoons- Garlic Salt - 1 tablespoon- Paprika - 1 tablespoon- White Pepper - 1/2 teaspoon- Cayenne Pepper - 1/2 teaspoon- Seasoned Bread Crumbs - 1 to 2 cups, Panko works too!- Butter - 2 tablespoons- Fresh Parmesan Cheese - As desired- Tomato Sauce - 1 jar, or homemade- Mozzarella - As needed, shredded- Angel Hair Pasta - 8 oz.",
        "cooked, drainedInstructions:- Grab 3 large plates to start setting up your breading station.- Using a hand mixer, beat eggs seasoned with a little salt and pepper until foamy. Pour into the first plate.- In a mixing bowl combine; flour, salt, pepper, garlic salt, paprika, white and cayenne pepper. Pour mixture into second plate.- Pour Panko or season bread crumbs into the last plate.- Preheat your oven to 425. Add butter to casserole dish and let it melt during the preheating process.",
        "Browned butter adds a lot more flavor to this dish!- Begin coating your chicken into each of the seasoned plates starting with the flour, next the egg mixture and lastly the breading. I like to press the breading in deep using either a fork or using gloves. My husband LOVES the extra crunch!- Pull your casserole dish out of the oven and place the breaded chicken directly into the hot pan.",
        "Coat all of the chicken and then bake for 15-18 minutes.- While the chicken is baking, start to warm up your spaghetti sauce and start to boil some water for the angel hair pasta.- You'll want to put the tomato sauce directly on top of the chicken when it comes out of the oven.- Next top with fresh mozzarella and place back into the oven for another 3-5 minutes and bump up your oven temperature to 450 or 500 so you get a nice crunch on the chicken and the mozzarella.- Drain your pasta and serve 2-3 tenders or one chicken breast on top of the pasta.",
        "Serve with veggies of your choice!This Chicken Parmesan recipe may seem a little time intensive, but after making it once or twice it takes no time at all!"

        "Hairdryers a No-No When Drying Out a Smartphone, Says Protect Your BubbleNovember 05, 2012 --November 05, 2012 --(PRWEB UK) 5 November 2012A mobile phone dropped in the loo, pool, the sink or the bathtub is a common problem. What is not so common is the knowledge of what to do and not do next.Mobile phone and gadget insurance specialist Protectyourbubble.com lists some top ways to dry out a phone and not dry it out.DO NOT try1) Microwaves!",
        "The radiation from the microwave will fry the delicate electronics in the phone. The sparks created by the microwaves bouncing off the metal parts could also cause a fire in the phone.2) A car engine manifold under the hood is a pretty warm place, but its also too warm for the cell phone. It gets hotter there than the dash in summer. Vibrations from the engine could also damage the phone, not to mention knock it off the motor where it will be lost or run over.",
        "Do not put your mobile phone on the car radiator either.3) A hairdryer is a bad idea when used on the heat setting. It puts out too much heat which can cause further damage to the phones internal workings. Direct heat on a cell phone is a bad idea altogether4) A desk lamp may not appear to be hot, but it can be.",
        "While it might not be hot enough to melt a plastic case, it can be hot enough to damage internal circuits.5) Shaking the phone to get the water out might work, if the phone is one of the sturdy models that can take a beating. A hard shaking can damage phones not built to take that kind of punishment. Its best to avoid this unless the phone is listed as durable and tough.DO try1) Using an airing cupboard.",
        "This may take a while, but it allows the phone to dry without being over heated.2) Burying the phone in dry rice. The rice will absorb the water. Afterward, the rice can even be dumped back in the container. Be sure to avoid letting rice get into holes such as the mobile phone connection port or charger port. Covering it with sticky will do the job.3) Packing the phone in silica gel. These small crystals come in tiny packs inside electronics boxes. Its likely a smartphone package has one.",
        "The silica absorbs water and is very effective at this, hence its use in packaging.These techniques cannot guarantee bringing a mobile phone back to life after contact with water. But Protect your bubble can give piece of mind with gadget insurance that covers against water damage, theft and accidental damage.

        "In \"The Key to the Universe\" Severian mentions that the Hieros are the master species, the ones created by man and who escaped to Yesod. The Hierodules were \"found\" by the Hieros and are their servants. Famulimus and Barbatus appear to be Hieros, while I would assume that many of the watchers of \"Eschatology and Genesis\" at the House Absolute were Hierodules.",

'And thus infinitely far from me, though I fly so much higher than you.",
        "I guess at his desires -- no one can do otherwise.'\">> This is preceded in \"Eschatology and Genesis\" in the dialogue between Gabiel and Nod. Also, there is the story of how the Pancreator was behind a curtain, but when one peaked behind this curtain, he saw open space, because the Pancreator is infinite (and perhaps thus infinitely remote).

These arrangements come on top of the work the council undertakes throughout the year to prevent people ending up homeless.",
        "It helps fund extra bed space at additional venues that have been identified to cope with higher demand.There has been a national increase in homelessness, with homeless charity Shelter estimating that one in every 200 people in the country is now homeless – pointing to Government welfare cuts and lack of affordable housing as the main reasons. In Nottingham this has seen the number of people found rough sleeping on a given night going up from 35 last winter to 49 at the latest count.",
        "The number was just three in 2010.This means people may see more people on the streets as although all are offered support, some don’t accept it, for a variety of complex reasons. Others may be beggars who are not homeless. People are urged to donate to charities which support the homeless if they want to help.",
        "The City Council has launched a campaign to assure people that measures are in place to help the homeless and to urge anyone who sees someone who needs help to contact Framework.Over the winter every year, Nottingham City Council leads a multi-agency group, including Framework Housing Association, hostels and local churches, which aims to prevent new, repeat and entrenched rough sleeping, as well as reducing the risks to the health and well-being of those who sleep on the streets.",
        "They are identified, assessed, supported and accommodated in Nottingham or reconnected back to their local community if they are not from Nottingham. Last year, the winter arrangements helped prevent 193 people from sleeping rough.Nottingham signed up to a No Second Night Out approach, which seeks to ensure no individual arriving on the streets for the first time will sleep out for more than one night.",
        "Nottingham’s Cold Weather Plan measures are implemented from November to March, regardless of the actual temperature or weather conditions during that period. However, in in order to safeguard health in extreme weather, extra provision will be made available this year to those who have rejected accommodation offers.The Winter Shelter is managed by Emmanuel House in partnership with city churches and other agencies. Its primary goal is to reduce rough sleeping and risk of rough sleeping.",
        "The winter arrangements involve:• Providing sufficient bed spaces to meet expected demand each night – prioritised in terms of reducing risk and who would benefit most, rather than on a first come first served basis• A nurse-led team provides practical healthcare, assessment, treatment, advice and support via drop-in clinics and outreach to those who are homeless, in hostel accommodation or vulnerably housed in Nottingham.",
        "Homeless people are also signposted to drop-in clinics that are held at various venues on different days throughout the week• A homeless prevention service works with people with drug and alcohol problems who are ‘sofa surfing’ and have the potential to end up on the streets, or are vulnerably housed and having difficulties sustaining their tenancies. The service supports people to maintain their homes, and reduce the risk of potential homelessness.",
        "Citizens Advice Housing Advice provides free, independent and impartial advice to those with housing or housing related debt issues.• The council’s Community Protection Officers operate in the city centre and every Nottingham neighbourhood, and will identify anyone sleeping rough and help anyone at risk to access support and accommodation.",
        "On Friday and Saturday nights Street Pastors from 24 different city churches are out and about in Nottingham and are also well placed to identify anyone at risk of rough sleeping and can help with accessing accommodation and support options.• Supported accommodation providers are asked to refresh their allocation, assessment and eviction processes to reduce the risks of an individual losing a placement and becoming street homeless.",
        "Where possible and appropriate, Nottingham City Homes are committed to prioritising and fast tracking applications from people who are assessed as at risk of rough sleeping at this time of year.Portfolio Holder for Planning and Housing, Councillor Jane Urquhart, said: “Despite huge Government cuts, we are committed to ensuring that nobody need sleep on the streets of Nottingham.",
        "We work with Framework and other agencies all year round to prevent and address homelessness, and over the winter we always put measures in place which add further support when people need it the most – helping 193 people off the streets and into accommodation last year.“The situation has undoubtedly got worse due to Government cuts to funding for councils and welfare cuts impacting on household incomes, as well as a lack of affordable homes.",
        "On top of our ongoing efforts to tackle homelessness, we have committed over £100,000 towards support measures over the winter period. We have also launched a campaign to assure people that measures are in place to help the homeless and to urge anyone who sees someone who needs help to contact Framework on 0800 066 5356.”Andrew Redfern, Chief Executive of Framework, said: “The level of rough sleeping is rising across the country and sadly, Nottingham is no exception.",
        "This takes a terrible toll on those involved, especially if they already have serious health problems. We strongly support the City Council in its efforts to ensure that no-one is forced to sleep rough, especially during the winter months. The decision to implement the Plan for the whole of this period, not just the coldest nights, is especially welcome.“A combination of circumstances have put services for homeless people under extreme pressure. So this is a time for partnership working.",
        "In this way we can avoid the worst consequences of rough sleeping for the people who find themselves resorting to it. There is a shared aim to get as many people indoors as possible, and to do so as quickly as we can.”"

        "No Big Z, No Problem For CubsNaturally, Carlos Zambrano comes to mind with the Marlins in town for a three-games series.Big Z isn’t scheduled to pitch, which is a shame.",
        "It would’ve been fun to see him wearing a visitor’s uniform on the Wrigley Field mound, and more interesting to see what kind of reaction he’d get from the home crowd (I imagine a standing ovation?).But there was never any doubt Zambrano needed to depart Chicago’s North Side when Theo & Jed dealt him to Miami in January.Carlos had worn out his welcome long before walking out on the team in Atlanta last August, which was rightfully the last straw for the organization.April 8 post: Sadly, the once promise of a would-be ace steadily declined into a pitcher no longer welcomed or worthy of wearing Cubbie Blue.Of course, it’s easy to gripe about the trade for Chris Volstad, who’s been horrific, and think how much better-off the Cubs might be with Zambrano in the rotation.El Toro, however, hasn’t had the season many thought he would given a change of scenery and the guidance of Ozzie Guillen.Granted, he defeated Washington in his 300th career start last night.",
        "But it was his first win since June 3 and snapped a four-game losing streak. His season record is (5-7) with an unimpressive 4.22 ERA.It’s fairly obvious at age 31 Zambrano isn’t the pitcher he once was, or the pitcher many Cubs fans remember him to be. His fastball isn’t as fast and his endurance not the same, either. All to be expected.His lack of command, however, remains in tact and serves as the primary source of his disappointing season.Zambrano’s 57 free passes leads the Marlins.",
        "It’s 23 more than Josh Johnson’s 34, second worst on Miami, in the same amount of innings pitched, and 39 more than Mark Buehrle’s team leading 18 walks in 13 more innings pitched than Zambrano.Jeff Samardzija, for example, leads the Cubs with 37 walks in 17 outings, one fewer start than Zambrano.That’s not to say Zambrano is no longer a serviceable starter. He’s still capable of winning 10-12 games and eating close to 200.0 innings.Is it worth $18M per year? Hardly.",
        "But with the Cubs forking over the $16.5M to Miami to pay for it, I’d say the Marlins found a pretty good deal–for the time being.That said, it’s never been strictly about the numbers with Carlos.",
        "His knack for childish behavior sealed his fate on a Cubs team ripe with youngsters and in desperate need of a culture change.January 5 post: The Cubs, unquestionably, needed a change of culture after two consecutive losing seasons, and it doesn’t take a baseball mastermind like Epstein to understand trading Zambrano was not only critical in re-booting the Cubs’ clubhouse chemistry, but a most necessary one at that.Rebuilding is a slow and methodical process. It takes time and patience.",
        "It’s tough enough without the distraction of a fit-throwing veteran ready to burst after every Starlin Castro fielding error or 12-game losing streak.The fact is, Chicago would be no better-off with Zambrano in 2012 than they were in 2011, or 2010, or 2009 for that matter.As I’ve always said, I’ve enjoyed watching Carlos Zambrano pitch, as long as it wasn’t for the Cubs."

        "But it’s important not to get overly caught up in the post facto narrative your brain is going to create as it looks through the lens of that putrid score.- The truth is that the Oilers had a sh*t ton of great chances, and whiffed on a bunch of them.",
        "And the few they didn’t whiff on were mostly stopped.- The Sabres on the other hand had fewer and less dangerous chances, but seemingly scored on all of them (and by my count, scored on three that weren’t really chances at all!)- Make no mistake, these were two world-class tire fires going at it, and the Oilers have a lot to clean up, just as they did after the Flames victories. But the Sabres were by far the larger and stinkier of the two tire fires.",
        "Rewatch the game if you don’t believe me (I’m doing that right now to confirm my post game comments, and yes, it hurts a lot).- The truth is, we see this kind of thing regularly – goaltending extremes will pretty much always override whatever happens with the rest of the team. What I mean by that is that great goaltending will overcome a huge deficit in play, and bad goaltending will torch a big advantage in play. And the latter is what happened tonight.- What’s that old saying?",
        "“Goaltending is 50% of the game – unless you don’t have it, in which case it’s 100%”. Yup.- On a side note, the reffing was horrific, as it always is when Tim Peel is soiling the ice with his presence.",
        "But that’s not why the Oilers lost.Game at a GlanceLeaderboard- Milan Lucic, Benoit Pouliot each had 1 goal- Leon Draisaitl blasted 6 shots on goal- Leon Draisaitl was most active on the team with 8 shot attempts- Leon Draisaitl was the faceoff champ at 70.0% (7-3)- Patrick Maroon, Jesse Puljujarvi drove shot attempts most with on-ice 5v5 CF% of 75.0- Anton Lander trailed the team in 5v5 on-ice shot attempts at 50.0% (4-4)- Milan Lucic was the big hitter with(click image to embiggen)Forward Lines – Shots Taken(click image to embiggen)Player/Pair/Line – Head to Head – CF, DFF, TOI(click any image to embiggen)NHL Media HighlightsClick the link to play the associated highlight videoOkposo’s first goal with SabresLucic’s first goal as an OilerGionta’s tip-in goalLehner’s point-blank saveGionta’s second goal of gamePouliot buries the reboundO’Reilly’s power-play goalTalbot’s great glove saveLehner’s strong kick saveO’Reilly’s goal from center iceMoulson’s top-shelf goalAdvertisements4 thoughts on “G3 2016-10-16 Ermagerd, wournded Burffalo r darngerous!”In the third at 5 on 3 the point shot bounds off the boards and goes to six of net where Talbot pad stops it.",
        "This about the 6:50 mark.Pretty sure that puck goes in. Even worse for Talbots night.I wonder, are you able to get that clip? Talbots glove hides where the puck is and he slips it out.Hmm, interesting. Let me take a look, I think I have a way to capture it as a clip if soYeah, I think I see what you mean around 7:00 left. it’s certainly possible it might have been over the line, but as you say, it looks like Talbot’s glove is covering it so can’t be called anyway.",
        "Of course, officials have disallowed an Oiler goal where it was visibly over the line and not covered, so I wouldn’t put it past them to call a covered puck a goal against!"

        "speaking of the soul. The only part of the computer that can speak directly to a human being without hiding what it is.Have you read Neal Stephenson’s paean, In the Beginning was the Command Line? If not, I recommend the digression. It’s a long way ’round to the same thing I am saying here, but a better one all the same.The computer programmers reading this mostly understand already. But this isn’t for them, I preach not to the choir.",
        "Let me tell you a secret you could never learn at Hogwarts: should a muggle learn the command line, the muggle becomes a wizard. It is true. Full command of your computer is yours, anyone’s. But it comes at a price…The cost isn’t money. And the only pounds of flesh are the ones you will add sitting in front of a computer screen. No, the price is time. You cannot become proficient at the command line overnight. Yet you can get started easily with little fuss.Try it now!",
        "If you are on a Microsoft Windows machine, look for ‘Command Prompt’. PowerShell is the real wizard’s tool here, but not required. If you are on an Apple Macintosh, look for ‘Terminal’. If you are on Linux . . . never mind, if you are on Linux you already know what to do.Now, there you are. Go ahead. Use it. What are you waiting for?OK, I lied. There is a great deal of fuss involved. Using a command line is a pain in the ass.",
        "It gives you no help at all, although some command lines allow you to type ‘help’ and get some kind of semi-useful response. On a command line you are left alone in a digital wilderness without a map or a compass. Even experts spend a lot of time searching the web for clues and reading documentation to discover which command they should use or configuration file they should tweak to some particular end.",
        "Or, more likely, what they are doing wrong in their commanding and tweaking because it seems like there is no end in sight. By their nature command lines are damn hard to use; this is why we invented Graphical User Interfaces, even if they really are rather useless in furthering a human’s dialogue with the computer. At least they let a regular person get basic tasks done.Of course there are those working on Artificial Intelligence designed to create an actual dialogue.",
        "Making it so you simply discuss your need with the computer until you arrive at a solution together. But, in truth, this is a long way off; and even if we manage to make a conversation between a human and a computer more clear than that between two random humans it will still fall short of the ideal.Why? Because we will be making the computer talk like a human and understand like a human.",
        "It doesn’t give you the wizardly power over the computer a command line can give you; it simply means you will be arguing with your computer because it did what you said and not what you meant.There is no such confusion on the command line. There you speak directly to the soul of the machine and it does exactly what you say. You can get it wrong, certainly, but it’s always you getting it wrong. Not the computer. You. Yet get it right and your computer will always do exactly what you want.",
        "The only problem is that time thing I mentioned. Only someone obsessed with computers would spend the time and effort and directionless anger required to master the command line. People like me.Here’s where I admit I lied again. I really am talking to computer programmers, my sisters and brothers in code. Those who know of what I speak because they too have screamed in frustration when something that ought to work just isn’t working. Over and over, not working no matter what we try.",
        "Pounded the desk because we searched and found hundreds of people complaining about exactly the same problem, but no one posting a useful explanation of why. Maybe you find some cryptic incantation that fixes or at least changes your problem, but you don’t know why. And not knowing why means you haven’t gained the conceptual framework required to avoid other classes of the same problem.",
        "It means you haven’t gained a better understanding of the computer’s soul.There are lots of things we could do to fix the command line, yet we do not do them. We could add a basic ‘help’ command everywhere; a command that when entered without an argument or option assumes you are lost and need a map. We could write better documentation and we could make it easier to find.",
        "We could even come up with a lingua-franca of commands sharing similar arguments and options so we don’t have the extra cognitive load of knowing the meaning of ‘–foo’ is always entirely different depending on context. We could do many things to improve the command line experience, but it won’t be enough.Not until we add one more option. Like ‘–help’ (or ‘-h’ or ‘-?’) this option has the same meaning for every single command.",
        "But this option doesn’t describe a command or sub-commands or arguments or options. No, it does something different–it tells you why.And that is why I’m begging those creating or maintaining command line software to add this new option: we need ‘-e’ or ‘–explain’.Recent Comments"

        "As the Philadelphia Eagles prepare to open training camp on July 25, we examine whether the team is better or worse than last season at each position. We continue with the tight ends.BETTERZach ErtzThis kid is poised to have a breakout year, period.You could just see him beginning to take over games late last year, especially when the Eagles were down inside the red zone.",
        "Ertz reeled in all five of his touchdown catches over the second half of the season, including one in their playoff loss to the New Orleans Saints.You could just see it looking at the guy back in training camp. At 6’5, 250 pounds, Ertz may have the body of a tight end, but he runs very fluidly, almost like a wide receiver.",
        "Don’t worry about his 40 time, Ertz has deceptive speed, plus he knows how to use his body to shield the ball from defenders.Tight ends often experience a leap in production during their second season, and it certainly appears Ertz is headed for a spike.",
        "The second-round pick finished 2013 with 36 receptions for 469 yards and four touchdowns, which were better totals than the likes of perennial Pro Bowlers such as Antonio Gates, Jason Witten, Vernon Davis and Jimmy Graham posted for their rookie campaigns.With the release of wide receiver DeSean Jackson, it’s only logical the Eagles would utilize the tight end more in the passing attack.",
        "If Ertz’s rapid development continues like it has, he can potentially push 1,000 yards and double-digit touchdowns in ’14.James CaseyIt took the Eagles awhile to find much use for Casey. Signed to a three-year, $12 million contract during free agency last year, some observers had expectations Casey would play a big role in the offense, but he wound up buried on the depth chart behind Brent Celek and Ertz.Casey started to see an uptick in playing time around December, though.",
        "Granted, he wasn’t targeted at all in the passing attack late in the year. However, Casey is a very effective run-blocker, and the Birds were pounding the rock while trying to put games against the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bears and Dallas Cowboys on ice.That seems to be his role going forward.",
        "Now that the Eagles finally found the right packages for him, Casey should have more value to the offense than merely a competent backup and special teams contributor.WORSENothing.THE SAMEBrent CelekCelek is approaching his 30th birthday, so one could easily make the case his best days are behind him, and he’s at risk of decline setting in—if it hasn’t already.",
        "Last year was a career renaissance of sorts for Celek, though, as he went from being known largely for his ability as a receiver to a key component of Philadelphia’s No. 1 ranked ground attack.Celek was a beast of a run-blocker in ’13, playing a big part in paving the way for LeSean McCoy’s first rushing title. According to metrics site Pro Football Focus, Celek graded out as the best of any regular tight end in that department.",
        "It’s that ability that will likely keep him in the starting lineup for another season over an emerging Ertz, at least in the beginning.And while Celek’s receiving totals were down, it was actually one of his best seasons in several aspects. His 15.7 yards per reception was the highest of his seven-year career, and three more than his lifetime average. Six touchdowns were also good for the second-best finish as a pro.The other thing about Celek is he’s dependable.",
        "The guy plays through injuries, missing only one game since reaching the NFL. Even if his talent begins to fade, Celek is going to give a ton the Eagles a ton of effort and will get the job done—for one more year, at least.THE UNKNOWNBlake Annen, Trey BurtonLast year, the Eagles carried four tight ends out of training camp.",
        "I don’t think they’ll bother this year, as an extra running back and/or offensive lineman could be in the cards instead, but the team does have intriguing options here in a pair of undrafted rookies.Annen is the one who caught my eye. He only managed to haul in 19 passes in four years at Cincinnati, but set the world on fire at his pro day, clocking a 4.41 in the 40-yard dash at 6’4”, 247 pounds.",
        "Annen is basically the same size at Ertz with wide receiver speed—far less polished, of course.Burton lined all over the offense at Florida, taking snaps at tight end, wide receiver, running back and even as a passer—versatility that no doubt appealed to Eagles head coach Chip Kelly.",
        "He’s only listed at 6’3”, 235 pounds, which I find small for a tight end, but realistically, it’s probably his position in name only.I don’t think either guy is ready for the main roster, but wouldn’t be surprised to see one or both make the scout team.BETTER OR WORSEBetter. Ertz can be a star in my opinion, as in right now, which is what makes this group leaps and bounds better than last season.",
        "Celek is still an effective receiving option, and found his niche in the Eagles’ run-blocking scheme, which should help offset any decline in talent. Nothing not to like here, including some interesting developmental rookies in the mix hoping to get noticed.>> Previously: Quarterback / Running Back / Offensive Line"

        "Saucy.[Photograph: María del Mar Sacasa]Get the RecipeRomesco is a classic Catalan sauce with a robust, coarse-grained, and spreadable texture. Recipes vary, but you can expect most to include a blend of roasted red peppers, mild ñora chiles, garlic, hazelnuts or almonds, bread crumbs, olive oil, and occasionally, tomatoes. The allure of this sauce lies in its fine balance of smoky, sweet, and nutty flavors.",
        "I've incorporated it into a sandwich here, but it's a wonderful addition to meats, fish, vegetables, or simply on a piece of good, crusty bread.Roasting the ingredients for the romesco is a must; the flavors meld, melt, and intensify as they cook under scorching heat. My recipe opts for canned or jarred piquillo peppers rather than fresh red bell peppers because I prefer their lightly acidic sweetness.",
        "These are roasted along with yellow onion, a handful of garlic garlic cloves, canned plum tomatoes (which make the sauce season-less), ancho chile (in lieu of the more difficult to find ñora), smoked paprika, and, to add richness and an extra layer of smokiness, an unorthodox ingredient: chopped bacon.Once roasted, the pepper mixture is pulsed in a food processor along with bread and nuts, which will give the sauce its trademark thickness and texture.For the sandwich portion of this recipe, pork tenderloin is quickly cooked by cutting it into 1-inch thick medallions.",
        "These are shredded, then crisped at high heat and tossed with peppery arugula. These crisp bits of pork are mounded on hearty bread thickly spread with romesco. Dig in, it's riquísimo."

        "We are prisoners of hope.\"Khumalo said the MDC-T will continue to appeal to Sadc highlighting all the injustices and oppression that Zanu PF is perpetrating on innocent Zimbabweans until the regional bloc sees sense in assisting the downtrodden."

        "Are there gaps in your smile? According to the American Academy of Implant Dentistry, “35 million Americans are missing all their teeth in one or both jaws,” with many more missing one or a few teeth. Living with gaps in your smile can be embarrassing, uncomfortable, and unhealthy. Your teeth are fundamental to your quality of life—you can’t eat, chew, speak, or smile easily without them.",
        "Furthermore, if you don’t replace missing teeth, this can lead to a cascade of other oral health issues, as you mouth and jaws adjust to try and fill the space left behind.In the past, the only solution to missing teeth were restorations like dentures, bridges, and crowns that sat on top of your gums. While they can be beautiful and effective, they do have their downsides. Fortunately, modern technology has revolutionized restorative dentistry for people with missing teeth. At Dr.",
        "Cindy Flanagan’s Houston practice, we often assist patients using dental implants. While you’ve likely heard this term in advertisements, from friends, or even at our office, you may not know exactly what dental implants are. That’s why we’ve made this week’s blog post all about dental implants! Read on to learn more about this state-of-the-art tooth technology.Dental Implants 101What makes dental implants different from other restorations is the way they’re held in place.",
        "As we mentioned above, regular prostheses sit above the gums. Dental implants, on the other hand, are firmly attached to your actual jawbone, just as a natural tooth would be. This is because implant technology replaces not just the tooth, but the tooth’s root. According to WebMD, “dental implants are replacement tooth roots.",
        "Implants provide a strong foundation for fixed (permanent) or removable replacement teeth that are made to match your natural teeth.” Dental implants are titanium posts inserted into your jawbone, where they integrate with your existing tissue. Once the posts are placed, we can simply attach any kind of prosthesis to them.Do You Qualify?You may be eligible for dental implants if:- You are missing one or more teeth.- You have one or more teeth that require extraction.",
        "This could be due to injury, fracture, severe decay, gum disease, or some other issue.- You are in good general health, since the placement of one or more dental implants is a surgical procedure.- You are in excellent oral and dental health. If you suffer from decay or gum disease, we will need to treat your condition before providing dental implants.- You have sufficient jawbone tissue for dental implants.",
        "Since implants are placed within and fuse to the jawbone, it’s important that you have enough jawbone material to hold them. If you do not, you may be able to undergo a preparatory procedure to help you qualify for dental implants.Dr.",
        "Flanagan will examine your mouth, go over your records, discuss the procedure with you, take X-rays, and perform any other needed diagnostic tests to determine if you are a good candidate for dental implants.Benefits of Dental ImplantsThere are numerous advantages to restoring your smile with sophisticated implant technology. Dental implants can improve your:- Comfort. Regular restorations, particularly dentures, can shift around in your mouth, irritating your gums and knocking against any remaining teeth.",
        "Dental implants are designed like a natural tooth, stable and secure.- Oral health. Dental implants hold prostheses to your jawbone, rather than securing them with surrounding teeth. WebMD explains: “dental implants don’t require reducing [shaving down] other teeth, as a tooth supported bridge does. Because nearby teeth are not altered to support the implant, more of your own teeth are left intact, improving long-term oral health.",
        "Individual implants also allow easier access between teeth, improving oral hygiene.” In addition to these important factors, dental implants are durable, so you’ll have to undergo fewer treatments to keep them in good shape.- Ability to eat. Regular restorations can move around in your mouth when you try to eat. They may even loosen or fall out if you eat more chewy, sticky, hard, or otherwise difficult foods. You don’t have to worry about this with dental implants.- Appearance.",
        "Dental implants feel more like teeth within your mouth, and they also look natural, especially with our beautiful crowns, bridges, and dentures.- Speech. Typical restorations can slide around in your mouth as you talk, making it more difficult to enunciate clearly. This is not the case with dental implants, since these are rooted to your jawbone.- Quality of life. All of the above benefits make your day-to-day activities easier, allowing you to relax and enjoy your life more.Dr.",
        "Flanagan can go over more specific advantages of dental implants for your particular case at your initial consultation for dental implants.Are You Interested in Dental Implants?We’d love to tell you more about them and help you find out if they may be right for you.

        "By Marieke Zoodsma -On our way to Prijedor, one of the major cities in north-eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, my host points out over the green, mountainous, and sunlit landscape and tells me: “Right over there behind those houses, they just found a new mass grave”. A couple of minutes later he explains that the men found in the grave are probably the men missing from the village up on the hill in front of us, since there are still so many unsolved cases.",
        "It is October 2013 and the International Commission for Missing Persons (ICMP) has just discovered one of the largest mass graves of the Bosnian war (1992-1995) nearby the small town of Tomašica, Bosnia and Herzegovina.The mass grave had the size of a football field, measured some 10 meters deep, and would, according to officials, hold the remains of around 1,000 Bosniak and Croat men, women, and children – as several media outlets reported.",
        "Until now, 435 bodies have been recovered from the grave of which 284 have been identified and buried in July 2014. According to the numbers of the ICMP, from the 30,000 persons that were registered as missing person at the end of the Bosnian war, so far 22,000 persons have been accounted for. A large number of the remaining missing persons are from the region where this mass grave was found, the Krajina.",
        "The big and looming question that remains: how could it take 18 years for such a mass grave, a couple of hundred meters from local houses, to be found?“The issue of missing persons can only be solved if the local community changes their attitude regarding the war crime that was committed” (Karčić 2013).",
        "The grave at Tomašica is located close to the border between the Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the two entities in which Bosnia and Herzegovina is split up after the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreements in 1995. During the war, Prijedor (which was to be included in the Republika Srpska) and its surroundings saw ethnic cleansing taking place on a massive scale – with as many as 52,000 non-Serbs being forcibly expelled from Prijedor’s total 120,000 pre-war residents.",
        "Three of the largest and most notorious concentration camps during the Bosnian war (Trnopolje, Omarska, and Keraterm) were located in the city’s vicinity. Professor Pettigrew (professor of Philosophy, Southern Connecticut State University) writes: “The mass graves are a testament to the genocide that was committed in Bosnia, as well as to the failure of the authorities of the Republika Srpska, as part of their genocide denial, to reveal their location”.",
        "Perhaps this must be seen as the most poignant explanation for the fact that not one individual living in the surroundings of Tomašica (and, for that matter, other mass graves) found it appropriate to notify local and international investigators about the existence of it. The three mutually exclusive narratives (that of the Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims) about what happened during the war, who started it, and who is to blame, keep on being perpetuated in Bosnian society today.",
        "One of the key ingredients of the Bosnian Serb narrative is the denial of genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina – hence the denial of the existence of mass graves since that would counter fact their story.With the finding of mass graves and the uncovering of new facts, the search for truth is continued – often even revitalized.",
        "On December 13, 2014, local as well as international media reported that 15 Bosnian Serbs have been indicted for crimes against humanity over an attack on a village near Prijedor in 1992. During this attack, 150 Bosniak men, women, and children were killed and their bodies dumped in the Tomašica mass grave.",
        "Prosecutors at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) have desperately tried to reopen their case after the Tomašica-site was found, especially the cases of the so-called ‘big fish’. For the trial against the former Bosnian Serb politician Radovan Karadžić it was too late.",
        "However in the case of Ratko Mladić, former Bosnian Serb military leader, new forensic evidence stemming from the mass grave has recently been tendered.The challenges with the search for missing persons is not unique for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Forced disappearances are rife in conflicts and are often used as an explicit tactic of war. They wreak havoc on families and certain villages in Bosnia were left after the war without any male inhabitants.",
        "Besides the grief these families have to live through, such circumstances have high economic consequences for rural, patriarchal societies where the male is the main breadwinner. In the Bosnian film Snijeg (unfortunately only available online without subtitles) the ramifications of such a situation are vividly put to life on the big screen.This year, 2015, the 20th commemoration of the ending of the Bosnian war will be held – the silence of those missing looming over the ceremonies.",
        "For the people in the small village up on that hill in north-eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, that is what is happening now.Further reading: An Appeal for Truth: The Human Rights Chamber and the Search for Missing Persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hikmet Karčić (2013)"

        "• Being one of the least populous states in the nation, Utah rarely gets to show off its muscle when it comes to athletic participation.But just look at what little ol' Utah has done this week, with four gymnastics teams from the state among the 36 teams to qualify for Saturday's NCAA Regional Championships.The top two teams from each region advance to the NCAA Championships, scheduled for April 18-20 in Birmingham, Ala.The fifth-ranked Utes, fresh off their historic Pac-12 win, should have the best chance to advance to the NCAAs.",
        "SUU, Utah State and BYU are all underdogs in their regions, but those teams should be proud of simply qualifying, say those who are involved.Only California, with UCLA, Stanford, UC Davis and San Jose State, matched Utah's numbers.\"It's a great thing for our state,\" Utah coach Greg Marsden said.",
        "\"With our population base, it's huge to have that many teams in regionals and with them all doing a great job.\"The last time the state was represented by two teams at nationals was in 2005, when the Utes were third and BYU finished 11th.This year, the Cougars are ranked 25th, while Utah State and SUU are not among the Top 25. However, T-birds coach Scott Bauman is hopeful his team can pull off a surprise.\"We are a scrappy team and we aren't going to give up,\" he said.",
        "\"Whoever is going to win it is going to have to earn it from us. Hopefully we can have our best outing of the year.\"So, what is Utah's secret? How did it make such an impact?Bauman gives credits to the Utes for bringing exposure and popularity to the sport.",
        "Utah has averaged more than 14,000 fans in the last five years, a statistic that Bauman believes has helped little girls throughout the state grow up dreaming of being gymnasts.Only a few, such as current seniors Hailee Hansen and Mary Beth Lofgren, have the talent to join the Utes. But others are good enough to compete at the other schools.",
        "BYU has seven gymnasts from Utah on its roster while Utah State and SUU have three each.Bauman said he modeled his program after the Utes'.\"It's a fun place to compete up there with great crowds,\" he said. \"We wanted to make our events a fun atmosphere and get involved with the community, but yeah, we are all still trying to catch up to Marsden.\"The Utes are hard to catch this year.",
        "Utah suffered losses at Stanford and Michigan, but has come on strong of late and won or tied for every award at the Pac-12 Championships except the balance beam title.The Utes are confident they can continue to carry the flag for the state this weekend and qualify for the NCAAs.\"We can't get too hyped up, but if we go in and do our job, we should be good,\" said Breanna Hughes.Winning the Pac-12s didn't create more pressure on the Utes.",
        "If anything, it has helped take pressure off, said Utah co-coach Megan Marsden.\"This group of athletes, I think, needed to believe that they could win,\" she said. \"I don't get a sense that they peaked too soon or that they will tank at regionals. I get a sense that they are continuing to build and to realize their potential.\"The same perhaps could be said of all teams in Utah in regionals.",
        "Chances are slim any of the underdogs will make the NCAA cut, but Greg Marsden said their presence at the regionals could be a good sign of things to come.\"I hope what we have done has helped other programs in the state and even across the country realize what can be done,\" Marsden said.Local teams at regionalsUtah (coach Greg Marsden)Regional • Fayetteville, Ark.Of note • The Utes scored a 197.925 to win the Pac-12 title two weeks ago.",

        "On Balance, Progress In North Korean IssueThree noteworthy things happened after the North Koreans detonated a small nuclear device on Oct. 9.First, the test itself was something of a fizzle, with the explosion being smaller than perhaps the North Koreans had planned and hoped for. This may have shown them that they weren't as far along in developing a workable atomic weapon as they had thought.Second, the Chinese government's reaction was quite negative.",
        "China joined in the moderate sanctions that were adopted at the U.N., it joined the banking sanctions in Macao that the U.S. had encouraged, and it apparently cut some military aid to North Korea and threatened further cuts. All this showed that the Chinese, like the Bush Administration and the Japanese, were concerned about the prospect that North Korea could become a full fledged nuclear power.Third, the U.S. abandoned its policy of not talking to the North Korean regime of Kim Jong Il directly.",
        "The Administration sent its able lead negotiator, Christopher Hill, to Berlin to talk bilaterally with the lead North Korean negotiator, and out of this precedent-setting meeting came the bare bones agreement that has now been reached in the six-party talks in Beijing.Anything can happen. Past agreements with the North Koreans have not proved lasting.",
        "But in this case, the North Koreans stand to receive quite a bit more in aid, in oil and so on, if they honor their assurance that their main nuclear plant will be shut down within 60 days and let in U.N. inspectors to verify that it has been.",
        "Further steps, such as disassembly of present nuclear weapons and/or turning them over to international bodies, have not been ruled out.It could well be that once Kim Jong Il begins moving in a more peaceful direction, the pressures on his regime will build to undertake even more reforms. North Korea, to put it mildly, has not been an economic success. Like East Germany in 1989, once the ice is broken, pressures may well build up on the regime for even more substantive change.",
        "In this respect, South Korea, Japan and China can all be helpful to the U.S.Once it became obvious that the Bush Administration was in no mind to undertake military action to block North Korea becoming a nuclear power, then some such deal was probably in the cards, and we now have to wait to see what happens next.It also should be recognized that what happens with North Korea may have some impact on the relations of the U.S.",
        "and other Western countries with Iran in respect to its nuclear plans.Just this morning, at his news conference, President Bush joined the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen. Pace, in distancing himself somewhat from anonymous U.S.",
        "military briefers in Baghdad over the weekend who had suggested that senior members of the Iranian government were responsible for the alleged use of Iranian weapons, such as roadside bombs and other anti-tank devices, against American forces in Iraq.It could well be that, just as Hill's contact with the North Koreans proved useful in Berlin, some mid level bilateral diplomatic exchanges may soon get underway between the U.S and Iran, looking forward at least to stemming tensions that have been building up between the U.S.",
        "and Iran in the Iraq war and elsewhere in the Middle East.One place to watch is Lebanon. If Iran backs off there, and Hezbollah suspends or lessens its efforts to depose the Siniora government, it could be viewed as an introductory positive step. But yesterday's bombing of a bus carrying civilians in Lebanon, the first such attack, was ominous.",

To check this use <\"AT^ command. If it's value will be other that \"gpio\" send: AT^SCFG=\"Gpio/mode/SYNC\",\"gpio\".",

I'd wager that it was this book that made it a classic storyline. Ten people are brought to an island via mysterious means, and trapped there by U.N.

They quickly realise the killer is one of them, though they've got no idea who. The story moves fast, dragging the reader along with it, until the inevitable conclusion.",
        "Because it's a mystery, I won't give away the ending, but it's good. It's very good. Christie has a gift for sketching characters while keeping them utterly believable, so you don't end up screaming at the pages 'Oh for fuck's sake, why are you so stupid?!'.",
        "I found Emily Brent, the ultra-religious bitch, particularly interesting, and I found myself wishing she'd died a little later; that perhaps she might have then been introduced to an entirely different kind of Revelation.If there's any problem with reading 'classics' it's that the plot has inevitably been diluted by repeated retellings by people who've clearly decided that, since the plot has already been figured out, they better focus on cheap tricks to keep the reader/viewer interested (I'm looking at you, Saw, but I'll give you a pass, Clue).",

        "The bookcover claims it was originally published as 'Ten Little Indians', but, according to Wiki, the first title was actually 'Ten little Niggers', and the poem and name of the island reflected that (in the version I have, it's soldier island). I read that some people believe that Christie was using the predjudices of the time to convey just how 'separate' the island was, and play into the fears we're given in childhood.",
        "Personally, I don't think the story has suffered at all for the changes, and, whatever deeper meaning Christie was trying to convey, it's no longer relevant. Of course Christie may have possessed those same predjudices, but somehow, I doubt it. (Mind you, I'm basing that on a very small amount of evidence).I just thought I'd better add, in case my countries recent stupidity with that Blackface skit gives anybody the wrong idea: there's no way in hell I want to see the original title in a bookstore.oh no!",

Motorola seemed skeptical in disclosing facts at that point of time but since Moto G was recently upgraded to Android 4.4.2; enthusiasts anticipated the same for T-Mobile Moto X. And it turned out to be true.News UpdateThis T-Mobile version of Moto X is now receiving the upgrade which is a file size of 147.6 MB.",
        "The Android 4.4.2 is the latest version of KitKat that includes all the goodies from the earlier installments, plus a few additions. The good news is, Motorola has customized the whole package and made a few tweaks into the update.",
        "The Software Version bumped to 161.44.25 and the notable changes are listed as below:- It added substantial support for services like printing photos, Google Docs, Gmail messages and other such content via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and hosted services such as HP ePrinters and Google Cloud Print.- It fixed all the bugs identified during the preliminary runs, including the ones that caused a few users to experience short battery life after upgrading to KitKat.- Another bug that caused delays in synchronizing email services like Microsoft Exchange was resolved, thus adding to the convenience of the user.This is a noteworthy upgrade, considering the fact that bugs and errors were fixed.",
        "Mobile addicts across the world will rejoice, for they can experience the smartness of Android KitKat flawlessly in their devices. This is significant development in terms of update.This variant is an unlocked GSM device so chances are, you can use it on networks of other service providers. In all probability, the update should not be affected and the installation should hardly take much time. The T-Mobile Moto X Android update is now available for manual download.",
        "It is accessible in the following sequential way:- Click on Settings- Click on About Phone- Click on System Updates- Click on DownloadRecommendationsFor ensuring a successful installation, it is highly recommended to install this update with at least 50% battery and a strong connectivity; preferably Wi-Fi. Follow the notification message and select download-> once the download is over, select Install-> Once the installation is over, and the phone will automatically restart.",
        "This marks the completion of the installation process. The phone is now updated to 161.44.25 – This build is same as the soak test.This upgrade is free in the carrier network and Motorola and Google has collaborated for a back up service for those in trouble. In case of distress, a user can contact them through the Moto X web interface and avail the service. There is still no news on other carrier variants of this update but we can safely hope that it will roll out very soon.",
        "Though the upgrade doesn’t appeal in terms of version number but it is definitely significant for users to live with the latest KitKat."

The Exilim Engine HS (with dual core processors) allows for high-speed shooting (.37 second shot-to-shot time, thanks to its continuous shutter feature), as well as high-speed image processing. This engine is also capable of facilitating slow-motion video recording.",
        "The Exilim EX-ZR100's 24-300mm lens is wide-angle (and can be extended up to 600mm with Casio's High-speed SR zoom technology). This camera features a 12.1 megapixel back-illuminated CMOS sensor with shift stabilization, which helps to ensure high-resolution images with low noise, even in dimly lit environments. This sensor also helps to reduce the blur associated with hand movement. The Exilim EX-ZR100 can capture 1920x1080 full HD video at 30 frames-per-second (fps) with continuous auto focus.",
        "This camera gives you the option of leveraging its full optical zoom and capture digital still images with high-speed burst shooting at 10MP while recording video. With burst shooting, you can capture thirty 10MP images at a maximum speed of forty shots per second.",
        "This model differs from the lower cost Exilim ZR-10 model in that the Exilim ZR-10 has a 7x optical zoom that can be extended up to 14x (whereas the Exilim EX-ZR100 has a 12.5x optical zoom that can be extended up to 25x), has a 28mm wide-angle lens, and lacks the EX-ZR100's Prerecord CS feature (which starts shooting video before you have fully pressed the shutter button, saving them to a continuously refreshed buffer).",

        "Determined to show that handicaps are not always limiting, Pete Zeidner, dealing with serious case of cerebral palsy, rode a recumbent bicycle with joy and purpose. Pete started the Pedal with Pete Foundation in 1993 with the goal to raise $1,000,000 for cerebral palsy (CP) research. Under his leadership, we reached that goal in 2015! We are now at $1 million and counting for CP research.",

He came in a wheelchair with cerebral palsy. He came because by that time, KSU had established itself as an accessible campus.",
        "The young man’s name was and is Peter Zeidner, known to family and friends as Pete.Upon graduation in 1986, Pete started job hunting and sent more than the requisite number of resumes and went on a number of interviews. Though the desired response was that attained by countless numbers of his classmates, he was offered none. Pete was disheartened. Some part-time employment was forthcoming through members of his church.",
        "It was less than satisfying because he wanted to do more, to be all that he Pedal with Pete in 1993 and the requisite 501c (3) (non-profit) status was obtained. From 1993 to 1995, Pete worked to get the logistics in order. But, the logistics turned out to be overwhelming.",
        "It could not be made to happen.Not to be thwarted, Pete the Pedal with Pete Foundation changed gears, took another route, and got back on their bikes (we know, too many metaphors).Funds could be raised for CP research through cycling and walking events! In 1995, the first of the fundraising event was held in Kent, Ohio. It was a start and success grew with each year.",
        "Pete would ride at least part of the way with the riders each spring.Best of all, Pete found a researcher who cared about people who have CP, and was doing research to help people who live with CP every day. Dr.",
        "Leland Albright was one of the first cerebral palsy researchers, and his work to develop the Baclophen Pump was funded partially by some of the first dollars raised by Pedal with Pete!In 1998, a small group in Emmetsburg, Iowa chose to begin an annual bike ride to raise funds for Pedal with Pete.io was begun.The PwP Headquarters had been located in Kent from 1993 until 2009.",
        "In 2010, the headquarters shifted to the Columbus, Ohio area.Over the years, research to help people with cerebral palsy grew by many orders of magnitude, along with the reputation of Pedal with Pete in their communities where the events were held, but more importantly, among the research community! The grants, at $25,000 – $35,000 each, might only fund a SEED grant, where a researcher is exploring a new idea.",
        "But, there are almost no SEED grant funders out there, and a researcher desperately needs to do the pilot research before they can proceed with the larger effort that might be funded by the NIH or CDC. Pedal with Pete makes a difference!In late 2015, Pete’s grand notion was accomplished: together, the events have contributed more than $1,000,000 to cerebral palsy research.",
        "This is only possible because of the generous sponsor and volunteer contributions, and the rider and walker commitment to the cycling events held in Kent and Columbus, Ohio, and Emmetsburg, Iowa. Over the course of the last 8 years, PwP has supported 23 grants.",
        "To make this milestone even more grand for PwP, Pete completed his autobiography: It Sucks to be a Gimp: Pedaling to Freedom within the same year, and turned over the subsequent publishing and profits to Pedal with Pete, and thus, cerebral palsy research.To learn more about Pete, and especially his early years, read his story or purchase his autobiography."

        "Aboard the Twist of Fate, Abd stands ready until the foreign ship has vanished around the coast. Tairasha gives the all-clear, and Abd moves to the second launch. He follows the trail left by the three women through the village, noting that the firefighting is now gaining the upper hand. He rejoins them at a small house on the inland edge of the village.Kismet, Aya, and Wind-of-Embers made their way to Tiyesha’s house to find the corsair’s third wife curled on the floor, bleeding.",
        "Wind-of-Embers calls down the power of Hakasarre to heal her and bring her to consciousness while the other two douse the fires. Once the young woman has regained an understanding of the situation, she describes the envoys from the strange ship that came to her. The leader was a bald woman with arcane tattoos on her scalp, loose blue clothing and a bright red sash; her second was a grim-looking man with a spear.Tiyesha pauses, and asks the group if they are with the Free Brethren.",
        "The response is “No, but we stand against one of their new enemies.” She accepts the explanation, and continues. She informs them that the intruders interrogated her about the potential whereabouts of her husband Barbafir; she told them she didn’t know, and the irritated bald woman stabbed her in the gut.",
        "The venturers tell her that he has a valuable treasure that multiple sides are searching for, and that they’re determined not to let the woman her allies have it.Tiyesha tells them that although she doesn’t know where Barbafir might be at any given time, she does know the location of her senior sister wives, who might be better informed.",
        "His second wife Hajuda lives on the Iron Triangle, and his first wife stays aboard the moving corsair city of Zarat.She follows the venturers as they return out to the village square. With the fires under control, several of the people of Plum Wine Island gather to thank them. They give the group several fine bottles of the local vintage; Abd passes his to Wind-of-Embers.As the celebration continues, a ship moves around the southern coast of the island.",
        "The venturers recognize it as the same vessel rigged like their own, likely returning to see if the visitors had left. The enemy ship changes course and sets out to high sea. The group returns to the Twist of Fate, though not before Tiyesha insists on coming with them — she dislikes the thought of being targeted again, and Plum Wine Island has no defenders as doughty as the venturers.Captain Tairasha hails the four as they board.",
        "Once he’s been quickly introduced to Tiyesha, he asks if the ship should pursue the windrigger or make for the home of Barbafir’s next wife. The venturers quickly decide on the latter. With Zarat likely much better-defended against an Ascending Flame ship, they set course for the Iron Triangle. Aya shows remarkable fortitude in calling the winds through the night, supported by Wind-of-Embers, who brings her various blends of tea every couple of hours.",
        "The Twist of Fate easily reaches the Iron Triangle before midday.The island easily stands out from its neighbors. A wedge-like mountain dominates the majority of its surface, with a scattering of vegetation around the coast. A forge-town sits on one of the island’s three “points.” A pair of metal fences running out to two large rocks offshore protect the harbor, allowing only one path in between the rocks. Tairasha notes that in times of danger, the town can raise a chain to close off the entryway.",
        "He also points out the slagthrowers on the quays, catapults that can be loaded with burning forge refuse to use against a trapped vessel.As the Twist of Fate moves towards the entry, they note another ship at anchor near one of the two large rocks. The squatter vessel seems to have hatches for oars — a sailing ship with the capacity to act as a galley.",
        "With the use of Tairasha’s spyglass, Kismet notes the figurehead of a burly chained humanoid, and recognizes the ship immediately: the Deathless Slave, a ship from Izir’s fleet. She tells the others to be on their guard. But the Iziran vessel seems lightly manned, and the veiled figure watching them gives no signs of hostility.The Twist of Fate sails into the passage and docks at one of the three open quays. Tairasha gives Kismet the order to buy some nails and chain as cover for their purpose.",
        "The group disembarks, and Kismet begins negotiating with the orcish spokemsan. Abd, Aya, and Wind-of-Embers take Tiyesha with them to the foundry, where Tiyesha says that Hajuda works as an overseer.They find the strapping, tattooed orc Hajuda inside, yelling at a worker about the danger of burning another to off. She initally assumes they’re here to look at the ironworks; they reveal that they actually wish to speak about her husband.",
        "As she tenses, Tiyesha steps forward and introduces herself as another of Barbafir’s wives. She relates the tale of how the bald woman stabbed her and left her for dead, but the fire-priest — with a gesture to Wind-of-Embers — healed her and saved her life. Hajuda gives the elf priestess a look of respect, then embraces Tiyesha.Abd and Wind-of-Embers stress that Hajuda may also be in danger.",
        "A mere moment after their observation that the Iron Triangle does seem well-defended, cries of alarm echo from the docks. “Or not,” sighs Aya.The venturers race from the foundry, where they see a chaotic brawl breaking out. The Iron Triangle’s workers seize what weapons or deadly tools they may, as they fight against what appear to be drowned men, still sloughing seawater onto the docks.",
        "As the group races to join in, they see an even more alarming sight — each of the slagthrower mounts is under attack, with a nine-foot undead monster attempting to wrest control of each one under the direction of what seems to be a living corsair. And with the slagthrowers under the invaders’ control, the Twist of Fate would be a duck on the water…"

Probably some guy in Germany, who would tell me that somehow the giant diesel monstrosity is good for the environment, that’s who. As it is, I got tired of drawing actual giant bugs, but it is still Bug Week. Hence the robot bug terror, and the presence of Blue Beetle.Blue Beetle is one of my favorite characters, at least in the way that he was introduced to the DC Universe in the 1980’s.",
        "He was a fun, humorous positive character, that had a unique tone to his book, and was an excellent member of the humor based Justice League Ensemble Cast. My friend loves the character because of his Minimate figure, which is one of her favorites:The Minimate figure puts it out pretty well…he was a very happy, very positive character, free of the kinds of angst and grit that were beginning to become the driving force of comics in the 80’s.",
        "The entire 24 issue run of his series, and a little bit more, in fact, can be found in Showcase Presents: Blue Beetle. That link lets you buy it, and it is a good read, True Believers.So…what’s the story? Theodore Stephen “Ted” Kord is the second Blue Beetle, a superhero who was originally published by Charlton Comics and later picked up by DC Comics. By picked up, we mean that the library of Charlton characters was purchased…trying not to be gauche.",
        "This version of the character was created by Steve Ditko (the original artist for Spider-Man) and first appeared as a back-up feature in Captain Atom. Gary Friedrich (the writer and arguable creator of Ghost Rider) wrote the scripts from Ditko’s ideas and plot.When the character came to DC, Len Wein was the writer. You know, the guy that created Wolverine? Swamp Thing? Yeah…pretty solid comics writer, that is worth a look. His story was pretty straightforward for Ted.",
        "Ted was revealed was not able to pass on the mystical scarab, a convenient means for Ditko to explain his preference for a power-free character. This was the basic idea of the DC series as well, revealed in “Secret Origins” No. 2. Ted Kord was sometimes shown as an industrialist, the owner of KORD Industries; more often he was short on money, leading to his entering “get-rich-quick” schemes with Booster Gold.",
        "Probably because the series realistically showed him not having much time to manage the company, and that owning and maintaining a flying bug ship costs major cash..The Blue Beetle’s real super power was being smart, but not a know it all. Ted Kord had no superpowers; he possess a genius-level intellect, with an IQ of 192.",
        "He was proficient in numerous sciences…chemistry, physics, engineering, aircraft engineering, and solar power technology, as well as an understanding of alien technology he encounters as a superhero. Despero once claimed that Ted’s mind was second only to that of J’onn J’onzz…who is a Martian.",
        "Former Justice League teammate Guy Gardner claims that Ted was smarter than Batman, “although nobody ever noticed.”That kind of thing…the humor, the fun…a whole lot of that is gone from modern comics, and its a big part of why I miss the Blue Beetle as a character. In fact, This version of Blue Beetle has been ranked as the 61st greatest comic book character of all time…and as a comics fan through and through, I can tell you, 61 is impressive.",
        "There are over 100 members of the Avengers alone, and don’t get me started on the X-Men.",
        "IGN ranked this version of the Blue Beetle as the 61st greatest comic book hero of all time on the basis that his intelligence, his “bwahahha” antics, his endearing partnership with Booster Gold, and his brave sacrifice during the build-up to Infinite Crisis all serve to cement this particular Beetle’s legacy, and make for some damn fine stories.Which is the point.Let’s not be shy though…there’s a second layer of metaphor to the art. Oh, yes there is, True Believers.",
        "There’s a giant industrial bug chasing down and making life tough for Beetle, the protagonist, and Pony. That can be seen as a metaphor for the corporate changes at DC that make this kind of storytelling fail to happen, the sorts of things that drove the New 52. That’s one way to look at it…and well within the intentions of the art.It’s also a Bug, from Comics, running some people that like to hang out together off.",
        "Making it a hassle to be in the background area, just by being loud, noisy, and generally spiteful. That could be taken as a metaphor for a far more local Comics Retail situation, which I’ve spoken a bit about.But hey…we have next issue to talk about!Coming up! Free Speech! Spider-Women!

        "OTTAWA—Canada plans to take steps to “strengthen” its cyber-warfare arsenal, according to documents released by the Department of National Defence.The documents are a rare public admission from National Defence that it is developing offensive cyber-weapons in addition to tools to defend against such attacks.“Cyber ...",
        "(is) increasingly prominent among the security and defence challenges facing Canada and its allies,” read the documents, posted to the department’s website.“(In 2017) we will advance our research in the future of cyber warfare to improve and strengthen both our defensive and offensive capabilities.”There is some debate over what actually constitutes a “cyber-weapon” or an act of “cyber-war.” The most commonly cited example is a virus dubbed Stuxnet, widely attributed to the United States, which in 2010 sabotaged Iran’s nuclear program before spreading to the wider Internet.More recently, Russia was accused of launching a cyberattack against Ukraine’s power grid in 2015, causing a blackout in the capital city of Kyiv.When it comes to cyber-warfare, the Canadian government typically likes to talk about defence more than offensive capabilities.",
        "But that appears to be changing, with former members of Canada’s defence and intelligence agencies openly musing about future cyber-war.In an interview with Postmedia earlier this month, Brig.-Gen Paul Rutherford said Canada will be sending “cyber-warriors” to Latvia this June to protect that country’s networks from Russian cyberattacks.“First and foremost, we recognize cyber as a domain of warfare … We are constantly under attack,” Rutherford told Postmedia.“We want to bring people into the trade to become what I call cyber-warriors.”The documents posted by the department state the Canadian Forces will create a new military occupation called “Cyber Operators” to bring in employees with the skills required to conduct complex cyberattacks and defence.“It’s maybe about time,” said Alex Wilner, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University.“I think implicitly what (National Defence) is saying here is that in Canada we see the cyber-domain as a military domain.",
        "That’s the way the Americans see it, that’s the way the Russians see it.”Other academics studying these issues stress that caution is needed before Canada fully embraces cyber-warfare — and note the challenges in even defining what “cyber-war” is.“Cyber-war is challenging all of our previously held notions of warfare,” said Stephanie Carvin, a former intelligence analyst who also teaches at Carleton. “Who is and isn’t a combatant?",
        "What is an armed attack?”The department raised the question of cyber-warfare in their sweeping Defence Review project, the results of which are expected later this year.Wesley Wark, a professor focusing on security and intelligence issues at the University of Ottawa, said he read the documents as a go-slow approach on these issues“Clearly there is a feeling that this is a future for Canadian military operations that the (Canadian Forces) is going to have to prepare for,” Wark said in an email.",
        "“But best that it do so openly rather than in the shadows.”Wark told the Star in September that escalation and proliferation of cyber-weapons was also a concern — a point that even John Adams, the former head of the Communications Security Establishment who has pushed for the Canadian government to prepare for cyberwarfare, conceded at the time.Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan was travelling Thursday, and was not available for an interview.",
        "In a statement, his spokesperson said any use of cyber-weapons would be “approved by the government on a mission-by-mission basis,” and would adhere to domestic and international law.In a statement, the Department of National Defence called developing a cyber-component a “key priority” for the Canadian Forces.“As cyberspace evolves and expands, it is critical that we look to the future and determine the optimal approaches to strengthen our ability to defend mission-critical military systems, building the future cyber force, and integrating cyber operations into broader military operations,” wrote DND spokesperson Daniel LeBouthillier."

After all, that’s where I learned the facts of life: something I would not have otherwise have learned from an educated source. (My educated source being an girl a with sex ed class under her belt.)Perhaps worse, I walked out of Sternberg with an MO friend.Then again, she walked out with a whole bunch of bais Yaakov friends.",
        "If anything, she flipped out by association with us, and not the reverse. She joined us in accepting all the important practices of bais Yaakov women, like long sleeves and tznius buttons. We exchanged copious emails tracking our progress, bemoaning the fact that we still, somehow, hated duty-length skirts, even though our teachers promised we’d get used to it after a month and never want to go back.",
        "We wanted to go back so badly, but we wanted to be good even more badly.However, since she didn’t attend a bais Yaakov, some of the finer points of tznius were lost on my Friend. As was illustrated when I brought her to school one day.I spent the evening before on the phone with her, reviewing all the guidelines for her Friday attire.1 – No denim. Denim is the cloth of the working man. Benos Yisroel are not men. Benos melochim do not work.",
        "Denim is not appropriate attire for aidel maidels.2 – No zipper fly. Flies are placed in a location that is wildly inappropriate on a woman. All it does is alert men to the available access points. NOT TZNIUS.3 – No cargo pockets or similar accoutrements. Twofold problem here: firstly that cargo pockets were “in” and trendy is never tznius. (Fashion is decided by men in Paris whose sole goal in dressing women is to expose them in new and exciting ways.",
        "In contrast, tznius is decided by men in Manchester, whose sole goal in dressing women is to hide them from new and exciting male imaginings.) Second problem: see item 1 on functional work clothes.4 – Skirt must reach four inches below the knee. This is so that when seated, the skirt still covers the knees and nobody can see up your skirt.5 – Skirt must not be longer than two inches above the ankles.",
        "Long, sweeping skirts are untznius because they draw attention to oneself, they’re sloppy, and they’re fashionable (at least among the gothic crowd, and a bas melech is not gothic).My Friend promised to heed all these rules, although she clearly thought I was overreacting. She was visiting for one day. What did my principal care what she wore?I almost died when I saw what she brought to wear. It was a jersey t-shirt fabric with a drawstring and cargo pockets.",
        "And it went down to her ankles.“You can’t…” I didn’t know where to start. It was obvious to me that benos melachim didn’t wear jersey skirts for anything but lounging around at home. Drawstrings hearkened to exercising, which has all sorts of immodest associations in the imagination of strangers. Worst of all, it was too long!“I’ll roll it up,” she shrugged.",
        "“What’s the big deal?” Rolling the waistband hid the drawstrings, so I calmed my palpitating heart and took her to school.“Maybe we can avoid seeing the Rebbetzin,” I comforted myself. My classroom was literally across the hall from her office, but she was a busy woman and we didn’t have many breaks in our day. It could be managed.“You’re crazy,” my Friend laughed.We did not avoid the Rebbetzin.",
        "At one point, we walked out of the classroom for a bathroom break and there she was.I saw her eyes drop to my friend’s sneakers (yes, she wore sneakers *face palm*) and begin the slow climb of the Bais Yaakov teacher elevator eyes. I saw her take in the hemline (the skirt had slipped down), the cargo pockets, the jersey fabric, the drawstrings…I cringed.The Rebbetzin forced a smile, welcomed my Friend. Asked her a few questions. Let us go.Phew…“See? That wasn’t so bad,” my Friend gloated.",

We listened to how important it was to present ourselves as benos melochim in our dress and our behavior.",

And we absorbed the visceral pain the Rebbetzin felt on seeing girls who didn’t value tznius cheapen themselves with the clothes they wore.“Does this happen a lot?” my Friend leaned over and whispered.I shook my head. Maybe two or three times a year.“It’s because of me, isn’t it?” she asked.“I told you so,” I whispered back.“Wow,” she said.",

        "A new Starlink teardown has revealed fresh details about SpaceX’s satellite internet dish, including how the company prevents its development hardware from being misused. Launched last year, Starlink relies upon both a growing constellation of satellites in orbit around Earth and an auto-positioning dish on the ground that communicates with them.The satellite network has been a work-in-progress for SpaceX, with multiple launches of its Falcon 9 rockets adding to the mesh.",
        "As that happens, gaps in Starlink coverage have been filled, and more users added to the system.On the ground, Starlink uses a custom satellite dish that links with a special router. Configured using the Starlink app, it’s designed to automatically move so as to keep the constellation overhead at the optimal angle.",
        "However, it has also proved to be a source of fascination among those curious to see what Elon Musk’s company have squeezed inside.One such group is the Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) research team at KU Leuven, which acquired a Starlink system when it launched in Belgium at the end of May.",
        "Researchers there wasted no time in opening up the dish for a teardown, and then extracting the software for further analysis.They came across some interesting tidbits along the way, not least the fact that SpaceX has clearly been iterating on its core dish design already. The COSIC Starlink hardware differs from what has been seen in prior teardowns, and there are some differences in connectors.",
        "Elon Musk recently said that the company is working on halving the cost of building each Starlink dish, since right now SpaceX is losing money on them.What’s particularly curious is how SpaceX keeps those development systems from getting out into the wild. “Development hardware is geofenced to only work in certain predefined areas, most of which are clearly SpaceX locations,” COSIC’s Lennert Wouters explains.",
        "“SpaceX is likely notified if development hardware is used outside these predefined geofences.”It’s not the only control on getting too much access to the underlying systems. The software exploration also revealed that SpaceX has prevented users from logging in to the live system, by including a check during boot to see whether the hardware has been fused or not.",
        "Consumer dishes are fused before they’re shipped, and so the login prompt is disabled.While hacking a Starlink dish is probably a bad idea – almost as much as mounting one on the hood of your car, in fact – it’s interesting to see the amount of work that has gone into building the system. It’s certainly cost SpaceX no small amount, with Musk suggesting that it could be $5-10 billion in investment before Starlink is fully cash flow positive.",
        "As well as the improvements in the pipeline for the Starlink dishes, currently SpaceX is working on the v1.5 satellites – with laser-based links in-between each satellite – and then the v2.0 update sometime in 2022.Repost: Original Source and Author Link"

        "There is a lot of debate happening these days in California around a proposed staffing ratio bill that has been introduced. It has led to considering the impact this would have on the quality of care for the dialysis patient in California.",
        "The Conditions for Coverage that govern dialysis providers nationally give this guidance: \"Adequate number of qualified personnel are present whenever patients are undergoing dialysis so that the patient/staff ratio is appropriate to the level of dialysis care given and meets the needs of the patients.\" Now that is adequately vague.SB 349, the Dialysis Patient Safety Act, introduced by state senator Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, proposes a 1:8 nurse to patient ratio, a 1:3 patient care technician to patient ratio, and a 1:75 social worker to patient ratio.",
        "When compared to the nine other states that have already passed laws with some kind of staffing ratio language included, California would hold the most stringent ratios.What if we look at California's dialysis industry quality measures as defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) compared to the states that have these mandatory staffing ratios? One would expect more staff means better quality of care for the patient.",
        "After looking at the Dialysis Facility Compare website, which houses public information by state for several quality measures, the results are surprising. This site includes billing and self-reported data for public transparency of dialysis quality of care. As it turns out, yes, California is lagging in a few measures namely hospitalizations.",
        "Interestingly, California fares better than its closest counterpart Texas in the important issue of survival.What matters to the HealthInsight ESRD Alliance in Southern California? First and foremost it is about quality care and access to care for the dialysis patient. Will care improve? Will there be access to care issues if clinics shut down due to the financial burden or shifts are eliminated due to mandated time between shifts? Will patients experience more individualized care?",
        "Will the current nursing shortage impact the providers' ability to meet these ratios?A friend of mine in California who has been a long time dialysis patient gave this perspective: most patients believe there is a staff shortage and current staff are spread pretty thin, which can impact the culture of care for patients. He did, however, relate that he has received excellent care in most centers he has dialyzed, in spite of the staff shortage he observed.",
        "So, the argument may not be that quality measures would improve with adequate staffing, but perhaps staff stress, burnout and turnover may experience a reprieve. And happy, healthy staff can provide better patient experience of care."

        "Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk predicts his company will sell a \"few million cars\" annually by 2025 — a massive leap over current production — and be profitable by 2020.The 12-year-old Palo Alto, Calif.-based automaker previously said it hoped to sell 500,000 of its stylish vehicles a year by 2020. Musk, who spoke Tuesday at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit, has overshot previous volume estimates.",
        "And some models have been delayed, including the Model X SUV, originally planned for 2013 but now on track for this summer, he said.Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas forecast in December that Tesla will sell 297,000 vehicles in 2020; its 2014 sales are estimated at 33,000.To meet his big volume targets, Tesla will need to expand beyond its factory in Fremont, California Long-term, Musk said, he'd like another Tesla factory in the U.S., plus plants in Europe and Asia, so it doesn't need to ship cars long distances to meet local demand.Asked if he would consider building a factory in Detroit, Musk didn't rule it out — but took a shot at the legislature.\"Not out of the question — maybe Michigan shouldn't stop us from selling cars.",
        "That would be a nice gesture,\" Musk said.Last year, Gov. Rick Snyder signed legislation banning automakers from selling vehicles directly to customers in Michigan — a move pushed by local auto dealers to block Tesla from selling cars.General Motors Co. this week unveiled a concept electric vehicle — the Chevrolet Bolt — that it says can go up to 200 miles on a single charge. It would sell for about $37,500 to compete with a planned lower-cost Tesla car.",
        "GM North America President Alan Batey dismissed ideas that the Bolt was aimed at Tesla, which sells the Model S for around $100,000, he said. \"They're for the rich and famous, this is for the people,\" Batey said.Musk told reporters after the World Congress event that he didn't view the Bolt as a \"competitive threat\" to Tesla because he thinks all cars will eventually be electric.",
        "He praised GM for moving ahead, but said there were no features in the Bolt or other new EVs that he wanted to emulate.Tesla's stock fell $15.24 a share in after-hours trading, or 7.5 percent to $189.38, on Musk's comments that sales in China were \"unexpectedly weak in the fourth quarter.\"Musk said that despite the decline in Chinese sales, a perception of charging problems had been reversed and that the company has recently seen an uptick.",
        "He said gains in sales in North America and Europe made up for the decline in fourth quarter-sales in China.The billionaire founder of PayPal and Space X has become the biggest rock star in the auto industry, making huge bets on batteries and vowing a massive increase in sales. He said he is focused on doubling production capacity and beginning work on the lower-cost Model 3, rather than seeking new deals with other carmakers.",
        "But he is open to preliminary talks with automakers about long-range projects.Musk reiterated he will be CEO until at least 2020 when he expects production to hit 500,000 vehicles. He said he will be at Tesla \"as long as I am alive\" but he may not be CEO forever.The company is now worth about $25 billion. Musk said by the time the lower cost Model 3 is in full production in 2020 it will be profitable.",

        "By Mary Kay MagistadChina's foreign ministry has called the killing of Osama bin Laden a \"landmark event\" and a positive step for global anti-terrorism efforts.",
        "But in China's fast-growing and increasingly free-wheeling online community of more than 450 million people, opinions have been mixed, ranging from relief to mourning bin Laden's death.In a spoof, which appeared online in China, shortly after the news broke, the narrator pays homage to the al Qaeda leader.\"Today we are here to deeply memorialize Osama bin Laden, the great soldier and founder of the International Islamic terrorist movement.",
        "He had a glorious life as a strategist, politician, financier and poet.\"Other online comments seemed to genuinely mourn bin Laden's demise — comments such as, \"yet another anti-American hero is lost\" and \"now the only terrorist left is the United States.\" Zhang Xin, the director of the state-run China Central Television's National Security and Military Channel, wrote \"Bin Laden was the greatest national hero in Arab history.",
        "He used his own power to fight the most powerful country in the world, America.\"What's all this about?First, there's a vocal nationalistic minority online in China who like to call themselves \"angry youth,\" and who see the United States, as the world's top power, standing in the way of what they see as China's rightful rise to the top.",
        "There's also a long-standing dislike in a larger part of the Chinese population for what's seen as American military adventurism — particularly in Iraq, though they're not wild about Libya, either.But the prevailing view in my Beijing neighborhood seemed to be more like this one, from a middle-aged guy named Xie.\"So the guy's dead already. What impact does this have on China?\" Xie said.",
        "\"He didn't do any acts of terrorism in China, and there were no Chinese interests involved.\"When I mentioned that some Chinese seemed to admire Bin Laden, Xie scoffed, saying, \"Maybe the Uighurs\" — the Turkic Muslims who live in the western region of Xinjiang — \"but not Han Chinese.\" For himself? He said it's a non-event.A young woman named Jin had a little more interest in the news. She said it has positive and negative sides.\"First, he's a terrorist.",
        "So as long as he's alive, people won't feel secure,\" Jin said.However, she added that it would have been better to arrest and try him than to shoot him in the head.",
        "She said China, too, opposes terrorist attacks, but believes in human rights, and that even Osama Bin Laden deserved to be treated as a human being.That level of concern hasn't been as much in evidence in China, at least in public, for the dozens of lawyers and activists who have disappeared or detained in recent weeks, in China's worst crackdown of its kind in decades. But a few sly comments, related to Bin Laden's death, have made it online.",
        "One said, \"That's one of the world's top ten most evil people dead — nine more to go.\"There are nine people on China's Politboro standing committee."

        "Lose Weight: Eat Healthy Food and ExerciseIt’s probably crossed all of our minds at one point or another, and perhaps we’ve even attempted it: completely cutting out our favorite indulgences from our diet. No looking at, buying, or eating the foods we absolutely love and crave. But has that worked for you, or even for others who have tried this way to weight loss? Maybe it has, and maybe you’re still going. The problem is, it won’t stick.",
        "At one point or another, your extreme restriction (yes, it is extreme) will come back to haunt you. It may even undo all the hard work you’ve done to shed a few pounds. How is that possible you ask? I’ve completely avoided desserts and fast food for three months, but the one day that I was out on a road trip, I overloaded on both!!! It’s really quite simple…Self-control and deprivation: two concepts that nag at all of us when we try to lose weight.",
        "They are also the key to the puzzle of restriction. You see, Social Psychologists have suggested that we have a limited capacity for self-control. Once we’ve reached the limit, it becomes harder for us to exercise self-control. It is, as it seems, a limited psychological resource. Deprivation, on the other hand, pushes us to ignore our own rules of self-control & has us doing things we did not necessarily expect.",
        "When we’ve been deprived of something we “love” for long enough, we may overreact when exposed to it once again.Restriction of food by avoiding certain ones, either for the self or for others, triggers both self-control and deprivation issues. It may work short-term, cutting out the delicious foods that make it hard to lose weight, but it is not a solution.",
        "Whether you’re trying to lose weight or trying to keep your family from gaining weight, the key is to master self-control and to eat everything in moderation.When it comes to your personal goals, building self-control takes time and should be done gradually. My weakness is anything sweet. I absolutely love desserts and could eat some every day. When I noticed my weight climbing, I realized that eating dessert every day was no longer an option.",
        "My initial reaction was to cut myself off from dessert completely. It worked for a few months, and then I went on vacation. Dessert was everywhere and, because I had not learned self-control, I found myself eating a great deal too much dessert. The result? The needle went back up on the scale, and I had to start all over again.This time, I decided to try eating dessert in moderation. I allowed myself dessert every once in a while.",
        "It was hard at first, because I was used to eating some whenever the chance presented itself. Within a month, however, it became much easier. Dessert became just another food group that was a part of my diet. Sometimes, I would prefer to eat a piece of chocolate every day instead of dessert at the end of the week. It gave me a sense of sweet tooth satisfaction, but did not hurt my weight goals.The walk-away lesson is this: Learning self-control is possible.",
        "Once you put your mind to it, you can start pushing yourself gradually towards your ultimate goal of control. Just keep in mind that you have to be patient and persistent. Self-control is a powerful thing, and takes effort to attain. Be sure, however far you go with your control, that you do not overdo it and end up at the opposite extreme of obsessive eating and calculation!When it comes to your kids, self-control over eating is very important.",
        "They are still young, and are still in the process of learning how to navigate the world. If they seem to enjoy junk food too much, do not resort to restriction. Research has shown that there exists a correlation between restriction and overweight/obesity. It also suggests that parental control of eating can lead to the development of eating disorders. Can you avoid pushing your kids in either direction?",
        "Yes!Just as you’ve taught yourself self-control and have avoided complete deprivation, so too teach your children. Show and present them with the right portion sizes. (Ask your weight loss coach about them!) Make junk food an occasional treat and always pack them nutritious and delicious lunches. Be flexible! If your kid really wants an ice cream bar on a day when you’ve got fruit salad for dessert, give it to him.",
        "You can use this moment to teach him about balance and trade-offs in eating.More important than these suggestions is the focus on teaching your kids how to make healthy choices on their own. The best way to do that? Modeling. Be a good example and they will follow suit. Don’t be too restrictive in your eating and they will learn that you can enjoy all types of foods. Make healthy food fun and enjoyable and they will learn to love it.",
        "Make good health your motivator and your kids will realize that their eating is important for their health. If you have picky kids, show them how you’ve overcome some picky choices of your own.There are a myriad of ways in which parents can teach their children how to eat and choose healthy. Restriction is not one of them. Doing this right, both for yourself and for them, takes a gradual yet steady process. Learning self-control may be hard for all of you, but it can be done one tiny step at a time.",
        "And always remember that your ultimate goal is to live a life of moderation. Eating everything under the sun without hurting yourself!"

The assembly, organized by New York Tech Meetup, highlighted the rising importance of New York’s tech community, which has grown in recent years and often deals with the kind of user-generated content that could be targeted by the PIPA and SOPA bills.",
        "Schumer and Gillibrand are both co-sponsors of PIPA, also known as the Protect IP Act, the senate version of the SOPA or Stop Online Piracy Act.Speakers lashed out against the legislation, calling it an overreaching tool to stop piracy brought by old media industries that are trying to buy laws through lobbying, rather than innovate.",
        "They said the danger of the bills could be crippling for New York’s tech community and for the city at large, which increasingly looks to the tech sector as an engine for growth.“These are tech entrepreneurs who would rather be in front of their computers innovating but they’re out here to save our industry,” said Alexis Ohanian, founder of Reddit.",

But it could have dire effects on the Internet if enforced.“This fundamentally breaks the Internet,” said Spolsky of the legislation.",

        "\"ShouldI go straight?\"\"Ineed to look professional.\"\"Bottomline, I want to land the job, but I don't want to sacrifice my locks.\"Yourhair or your job? That is the question. Hair is usually the first item to getnoticed in an interview.",
        "So what do you do if you wear dreadlocks and also wantto work in corporate America?Manyblack people have grown more comfortable with embracing hairstyles thatemphasize the characteristics of their hair, and corporate America increasinglyis more accepting of braids and short afros. But traditionallyconservative industries suchas banking and law still may turn you down if you don't look like what theyperceive as executive material.",
        "Wearing braids or dreadlocks could be thedeciding factor in whether you get the job--and, if you do get hired, gettingpromoted.Itreally depends on the industry, says Berlinda Fontenot-Jamerson, director ofdiversity for Disney ABC Cable Networks Group. Fontenot-Jamerson was a longtimeemployee of Sempra Energy, No. 19 on The 2007 DiversityInc Top 50Companies for Diversity® list. \"Discrimination laws have begun to address appearancein more conservative companies. You see less of that in entertainment.",
        "It reallydepends on the line of business, and even today, [we've] seen much progress,\"she notes.Rigidcorporate offices usually require that their associates wear polished shoes,tailored business suits and a simple hairstyle.",
        "MaySnowden, former vice president of global diversity at Starbucks Coffee Co., No.45 on the 2006 Top 50, and a longtime diversity leader at Eastman Kodak, one ofthe 2006 25 Noteworthy Companies, says aslong as hair looks neat, employers shouldn't have a problem with a black personwearing his or her hair in a variety of styles, whether it's braids or cornrows.Areblack men treated differently when it comes to hair than black women?",
        "Some saythat black men face a greater challenge to \"fit in,\" while others feel blackwomen bear a larger burden because of dual discrimination--race and gender. Forexample, Fontenot-Jamersonbelieves black men are challenged regardless of their hairstyles.",
        "\"It's not just hair.It's also looking too flashy or too radical,\" she says.She adds that fashion trends haveallowed black women to be more flamboyant in terms of how they style their hairat work.Snowden feels that,in general, it's difficult to say who is discriminated against more since lessthan a handful of black males have been promoted to CEO positions and even fewerblackwomen are CEOs.",
        "\"Black women have been very prominent in certain jobs, i.e.,administrative, human resources, management, [but] not sales, marketing or anyof the jobs that lead to CEO,\" says Snowden, now vice president of operations atCreative Wealth Alliance, aconsulting company in Utah.Despitethese differences, most black people do feel the pressure to look professional,either by wearing their hair straight or in short styles. Snowden believes thispressure is part of being black.",
        "\"I think that's part of our history, [but] wealso put that history on ourselves. Black women have been preferring straighthair--that has been a big area to overcome. People are used to males wearingtheir hair short or natural; they're not used to the braids or thedreadlocks.\"Discriminationbased on hair and someone's appearance is much more complicated legally.",
        "The1964 Civil Rights Act only prohibits employment discrimination based on race,color, religion, sex or national origin, making it illegal to discriminate inany aspect of employment, including hiring and firing. So even if you are firedfor wearing dreadlocks, discrimination on the basis ofgrooming is not discrimination on the basis of race. Existing civil-rights lawsdo not protect individuals against this kind of discrimination.",
        "Withoutwrittengrooming policies giving employees permission to wear their hair in cornrows orother hairstyles,race maynot be enough grounds for a lawsuit.So the big question:Should you hide or change your hair to \"fit in\"? Depends on the company, socheck it out before you apply--and look at how top managers, especially blacks,wear their hair. Then decide if it's the right place foryou.\"People should notblindly take job offers,\" says Fontenot-Jamerson. \"Make an informed decision.",

        "February 07, 2013 12:50pm PT by Tim GoodmanWhy It Doesn't Matter Whether You Like 'Community' -- or Tons of Other NBC ShowsThe reason I've written in the past that NBC chairman Bob Greenblatt deserves to gloat about the network's dramatic rise to No. 1 from No. 4 is very simple: In this day and age, running a broadcast network is extremely difficult, and exactly how you climb out of the muck -- NFL games, riding a big singing show like The Voice, getting lucky here and there -- doesn't matter. You did it.",
        "And it was damned hard.It also was written to be fair. Every network president eventually will stumble and be questioned or criticized. And these days Greenblatt must be looking at his assembled series and muttering the Tina Fey as Liz Lemon proclamation: \"What the what?\"STORY: 'Community' Bosses Address Chevy Chase's Exit, Post-Dan Harmon Changes and Why Netflix ReignsBecause NBC has tumbled back down to earth -- or under it, depending how you look at it. The ratings are gone.",
        "New shows have flopped; Deception and Do No Harm were not only lousy dramas but spurned by viewers. Worse for Greenblatt -- because it's his pet show -- Tuesday's second-season return of Smash hit the earth like a wayward meteor, down 71 percent in the demo from its series premiere and 39 percent from its season one finale.That's why the word \"repudiate\" is in the dictionary.Hell, Do No Harm went below Rock Center numbers, which is really saying something.",
        "Even Go On, a modest hit that's basically Community in a more broadly palatable form, is bleeding viewers. One of NBC's biggest fall success stories was Revolution, but it doesn't return until March 25 and will have been off the air for nearly four months -- which, for a serialized show, is really testing viewer loyalty.And now Community returns, the first episode from its new showrunners after Dan Harmon was relieved of his duties -- running the show he created.",
        "For a brilliant little series with a very small but loyal fan base, the switch at the helm and NBC's constant pushing back of the premiere has led to little flares of anxiety and exasperation on the Internet. The buildup of online chatter as Community returns Thursday night has been impressive for a cult show.PHOTOS: 'Community' Season 4 Premiere First LookLook, I happen to love Community. But it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you hate the new direction.",
        "It doesn't matter if you're pleasantly surprised that you can't really tell the difference. It doesn't even matter if you're just happy it's back.Because it's dead. You must have known that. And if not, here's your reminder: Community is dead.NBC has much, much bigger worries than Community, a series it essentially gave up on long ago.",
        "(If you want to see a similar pattern of network behavior, look into the ABC/Cougar Town archives and see how that ended.) No doubt the first thing Greenblatt is looking at with a certain panic are those Smash numbers. It's like the poster series for \"hate watching\" couldn't even generate that crowd to watch. Was Tuesday's premiere some weird aberration? If the numbers stay in nadir territory -- or worse -- Greenblatt will have his toughest decision as a broadcast network chief.",
        "On cable, where Greenblatt rose to prominence at Showtime, you can nurture the little ponies. At the network level, you're running horses. And if they don't win?Bang! Glue.This is the decision that will haunt and/or define Greenblatt. If Smash truly implodes, will he dump it and continue searching for a hit? Or will he take up a precious hour on the schedule for a show that can't be saved?STORY: Why Even DVR Won't Save 'Smash' RatingsSee, NBC needs to overhaul its lineup. No tinkering. No patience.",
        "Before the upfronts in May, it's spring cleaning time in Burbank. Do No Harm and Deception will be gone, as will Community, the retiring-past-its-sell-by-date Office, the wretched Guys With Kids (one would hope). Already 30 Rock has had its swan song. Outside of The Voice and NFL games, what's truly untouchable on the NBC schedule? If you went from fourth to first and back to fourth again, you'd do some soul searching.",
        "And one would assume that soul searching would lead to, \"We need to blow it up.\"Personally, I love Parks and Recreation -- it's one of my favorite shows, and I hope it stays on forever. I also like 1600 Penn, Grimm and Parenthood. But those are not exactly hits, so there's worry.Chicago Fire is not a show I'd watch regularly, but it does what it was designed for, and NBC needs to stay in the procedural game.",
        "Despite the star power in the sitcom Up All Night, the viewers never came, and NBC's decision to switch to a multicamera format with a live audience is a little bit like the crying doctor who keeps trying to resuscitate a patient who has flat-lined. Whitney and The New Normal? Betty White's Off Their Rockers? These are not keepers, people. These aren't shows that redirect a network skyward.Dateline? The Celebrity Apprentice? The Biggest Loser?",
        "A little long in the tooth.So, yes, enjoy Community tonight (or not). Pretend it's a wake. There's a reversal of course coming to NBC, and the only show to monitor for clues about how deep the cuts are going to be is Smash.Twitter: @BastardMachineTim GoodmanTHRnews@thr.com BastardMachine"

        "A modern take on a message in a bottle? A Saks Fifth Avenue shopper found a cry for help that had traveled across many oceans and countries... in the bottom of her shopping bag. Stephanie Wilson was looking for her receipt and instead found the handwritten plea, titled \"HELP HELP HELP,\" from Tohnain Emmanuel Njong, a prison laborer in China.",
        "Njong wrote that he was being held in a Chinese laogai, a type of labor reform school known to be used to imprison outspoken anti-government political figures.\"We are ill-treated and work like slaves for 13 hours every day producing these bags in bulk in the prison factory,\" Njong wrote in blue pen.",
        "The note went on to detail the isolation, abuse and terrible working conditions he and his fellow prisoners were suffering before concluding with, \"Thanks and sorry to bother you.\"Wilson stared at the tiny passport photo of a man in an orange jumpsuit included with the letter and was deeply shaken. And no wonder.",
        "Especially after the Rana Plaza factory collapse a year ago that killed 1,100 and wounded another 2,500, we are all becoming more and more aware that people are suffering to make things for us that we just throw away. The sad part is, it's not often that we have to confront it so literally.I remember shopping at a Forever 21 store after reading an expose of the horrible labor practices used to produce \"fast fashion\" and feeling sick to my stomach.",
        "Which is worse: buying a $6 T-shirt knowing that the low price is because of sweat shops or not buying it and putting poverty stricken people out of a job? I didn't ask myself if I really needed another white T-shirt because the answer to that is always yes. And no. And as this situation clearly shows, the problem goes far beyond cheap tees to even the shopping bag they come in.",
        "The real question is that now that we know, how can we answer their cry for help?For Wilson, thankfully Njong also included an email address and the internet set out to track him down. Eventually the note got turned over to the Department of Homeland Security since U.S.",
        "law makes it illegal for \"products made using slave, convict or indentured labor to be imported into the United States.\" (Saks denies knowing how the bags were manufactured and has opened up an investigation into their supply chain.)While the DHS isn't commenting on Njong's case specifically, it did say this is definitely not the first report of a Chinese cry for help ending up in a consumer's hands in the U.S.",
        "Also in 2012, a woman found a similar letter in a Halloween decoration she bought from Kmart.Just something to think about the next time you go shopping and are thrilled with the super deal you got on clearance. Is it really a good deal, after all?",

        "That gives the opportunity to be able to produce electricity in far away and isolated areas (with out grid or limit access to the public grid) where electricity is sparse, without dependency on fossil fuel. By that the secluded areas will be self-sufficient and no longer have to depend solely on more pollutant energy sources.",
        "The bonus is more sustainability and less pollution and will bring endless possibilities for secluded and impassable areas.In Greenland the entrepreneur is already working on establishing roads and making a foundation for the turbine.The Vejroe project:The second project is on a small danish island with Vejrø Resort as contractor. According to the schedule the Viking Wind turbine is to be erected medio October 2018.Vejrø Resort offers luxury island holidays in magnificent surroundings.",
        "The Viking Wind turbine is a part of fulfilling their mission of sustainability in the energy field while accentuating aesthesia and minimize the interference with the surrounding nature.The turbine will , combined with diesel, sun energy and battery Stored energy, reduced the use of fossil fuel and supply the resort with clean energy and thereby be a major contributor in minimizing the use of fossil fuel, for the benefit of more sustainability (further reading about the Vejrø resort here).Viking Wind is proud to be a main actor in both exciting projects!"

        "In the Gorgias dialogue Socrates makes an eloquent and most didactic differentiation between ‘teaching’ which provides the listeners with skill necessary to do things and ‘persuasion’ which leads people simply to do the things the orator desires.Aristotle, originally Plato’s pupil in the ‘Platonic Academy’ of Athens, later became a teacher on his own merits creating his ‘Peripatetic School’.",
        "In Aristotle’s view the function of rhetoric was not synonymous to, and was not exhausted by, simply succeeding to persuade, but should rather be aiming towards the discovery of the means of coming as near to such a success as the circumstances of each particular case would allow.In his Rhetoric, (from the Greek word ‘ρητορική’ possessed by a ‘ρήτωρ’ that is a speaker (in the ‘ρητορική τέχνη’ the ‘art of speaking’) Aristotle, perhaps counteracting Plato’s somewhat pejorative treatment of ‘rhetoric’ in the Gorgias, wrote that persuasion is based on three specific, distinct elements.",
        "These three elements are: ethos, the personal character of the speaker; pathos, appealing to the audience’s emotions and values; and logos, referring to the convincing evidence and the reasoning process (Rapp, 2010, in:Ethos, (the Greek word ‘ήθος’ means character), pathos (the Greek word ‘πάθος’ means suffering) and logos (the Greek word ‘λόγος’ means logic) constitute for Aristotle an ‘equilateral triangle’ where each one of the three terms, as is the case with the length of each side of this type of a triangle, has the same strength as the other two.In their book bearing the title ‘Writing Arguments’ Ramage and Bean, (1998) have noted that: .’ Path.” (pp 81-82)For Aristotle the three elements for successful orators, as mentioned above, constitute an equilateral triangle and each of the three is as important as the other two.",
        "Indeed, a balance of the three is important. Too much of one is likely to produce an argument that readers will either find unconvincing or that will cause them to stop reading.",
        "Therefore, in Aristotelian terms in.May and Wisse (2001) translating into English Cicero’s work ‘On the ideal orator’ and Fantham (2007, The Roman World of Cicero’s De Oratore) analysing the historical era in which Cicero’s work was written present his suggestions for the training of an orator, showing that the Romans continued the Greek rhetorical tradition in the courts of law, the Senate, and during funeral orations.",
        "Cicero, one of the most famous statesman-philosopher of his era established the official oratoris, the duties of the orator: to charm or to influence the audience by establishing the credibility of the orator, to teach by presenting a message with sound arguments, and to move by appealing to the audience’s emotions.",
        "Cicero was convinced that a statesman-philosopher should speak on all topics persuasively and should be thoroughly knowledgeable in literature, philosophy, law, and logic.***************************************Honorary Professor in Management & Marketing, Business School, Durham University, United Kingdom"

        "The feeling that the inhabitants of Faro have about the splendid scenery of the Ria Formosa is one of great disappointment loss due to the construction, a century ago, of the railway line and the embankment that supports it, which shut off the view over the city's waterfront.So when any Faro resident goes to Olhão he can still view with a particular fascination the magnificent landscape of the islands, the marshes, the fishing boats, the setting of the sun below the distant horizon - it’s an ever changing scenario that feeds those feelings that touch our Atlantic souls.The blessing that enhances this essential part of Olhão’s identity has shaped its population as they contemplate the boats and the tides from the dockside, the terraces and the belvederes.So, it is with indescribable incredulity that I see the latest project from Olhão Council which translates into a desire to completely ruin the view from the city’s riverfront by extending the marina used for pleasure boats.This marina, which already is a shameless size that covers half of Olhão’s waterfront, is to continue its expansion from the current site to block off the view from the fish market with a second phase due to expand into the area near the pier where the island ferries dock.This is the will of the mayor, to shut out the timeless backdrop of views over the Ria Formosa.It's not so surprising if you look at the history of this city.",
        "About 25 years ago in a television interview, the maestro Almeida Vitorino stated that Olhão had been considered possibly the most beautiful city in the world, but on his last visit he was shocked to see that terrible changes had occurred.",
        "The conductor noticed the deep mischaracterization of many houses with 'bathroom tile' exterior finishings, aluminum frames glittering in the windows and doors, and uncared for buildings everywhere.Olhão invariably appears (or appeared) in reference books and international compilations on vernacular architecture alongside the most important places in the world with its carved lime recesses and mysterious medinas, it was the charming muse of João Lúcio and Artur Pastor among many others, this masterpiece of form, light and colour, has, over the years, deplorably been stripped of its character, bastardized and mutilated, without mercy, under the baton of successive Council presidents who have demonstrated ignorance, insensitivity and an enormous lack of good sense.Also, the strong population has not known, when facing the totalitarian dictates of fashion, how to defend their culture and their ancient values.And so we come to this ridiculous and shameful situation in which, at this point, the people who are standing up for the integrity of Olhão, its architecture and its culture, are almost exclusively the foreign community that has settled there in recent years.Let us list some of the official contributions to the disfigurement of Olhão:• The ruination of the Avenida da República, once a charming and romantic thoroughfare, but now with numerous beautiful houses and palaces demolished;• The state of disrepair and decrepitude of many houses and old factories which are lining up to be demolished, as has already happened to many of them, which, for their architectural importance, would in any other civilized country be exquisitely renovated;• The calamitous state where the historic districts have been left without character and where the only intervention that has taken place was the introduction of pedestrian finishings and contemporary fittings at odds with the whole area, with the exception of half a dozen houses renovated by foreigners who have returned to the era of whitewashed walls and wooden windows and doors;• Permission to build additional floors on front line houses so the view from many terraces further back in the city has been blocked;• Permission for the construction of the Real Marina Hotel and the adjacent apartments to the west, with a volume and an architectural style that is incompatible with the unique urban fabric of Olhão.Finally, and sadly, we have to add one more barbarity in this pitiable litany of incompetence, ignorance and lack of love for patrimony: the extension of the recreational marina - a boa constrictor that will slowly suffocate the stunning views over the Ria Formosa.Fernando Silva Grade, 2016__________By kind permission of the Barlavento newspaper where 'As vistas de Olhão' was first published."

What if the power goes out to your production facility or factory? All of your power will simply disappear and your production will be halted.",

        "With an estimated $10 - 15 billion dollars worth of damage, 7.4 million homes and businesses losing power and around 3.3 million without power even 3 days after the hurricane, it’s easy to see just how impactful and frustrating it can be to deal with natural disasters.However, Irene was just a small hurricane compared to the disaster that struck the United State in 2005.",

Over 81,000 businesses were hit by this economic disaster and around 450,000 jobs were lost. Over 2 million people lost power and it took over 8 months to fully recover power connections.Although few and far between, natural disasters have the ability to completely destroy your business.",

You simply hook up the system to your regular power lines and then it kicks into action as soon as it detects that your power has gone out.",
        "This gives you enough time to save your data, make some final communications or even continue working should your generator be large enough.It’s surprisingly simple to install as well once you have the right permits and determine the size of the generator. Specifications are handed out by the manufacturer and the installation can also be carried out by the same company. Units can also be customized depending on your needs, such as structural problems or challenges.",
        "They’re also capable of being hidden away in basements, or simply out of view so that customers don’t see them and they’re not an annoyance to staff.Noise and vibrations are the two main challenges that business owners face when purchasing a backup generator. Having them installed in the wrong location or without sufficient protection can often mean that they become a hindrance to other parts of your office or business.",
        "Thankfully, it’s easy to draw up plans and designs to ensure that your backup generator doesn’t lower the quality of life at your workplace.Although generators can be expensive, it’s also possible to purchase used generators that will offer you fantastic savings over new units. Mobile units can also be purchased for smaller businesses, or even for use at some. When there are size restrictions, a small unit can also be a blessing.",
        "However, it’s never a bad idea to have a full-sized permanent generator planned because they offer more customization and power to help your business stay afloat should disaster strike.Final WordsDisasters will eventually hit–there’s no doubt about it. When your power goes out, the last thing you want is to completely lost track of your business for several days and forfeit all of your hard work.",
        "Planning for continuity is one of the most important concerns in business, and having a backup generator is perhaps one of the simplest ways to prepare for adversity."

        "Dinosaur Pickles Its BrainAn unusual rock found on a beach is a dinosaur’s fossilized brain, paleontologists say.",
        "How did a squishy thing turn to stone?The answer, according to Alex Liu, member of a Cambridge team that re-analyzed the rock found in 2004, is that “the brain tissue was effectively pickled before it was mineralised, probably after the dinosaur died in a highly acidic and low-oxygen body of water.” He continues in The Conversation,.While it is not surprising to find that dinosaurs had brains, it is remarkable that these tissues can be preserved for so many millions of years.The revelations about this pickled brain rock have been widely reported, for instance by Science Daily, New Scientist, and Live Science.",
        "National Geographic is calling it the “first known dinosaur brain fossil discovered.” A detailed scenario of how the animal became buried, allowing its soft tissue to be lithified, is provided on Vox.com.Of particular interest are the delicate features that have been preserved. Liu writes,.From these structures, Liu infers that dinosaurs were smarter than scientists used to think they were.",
        "In a related article, Science Daily says that scientists’ views of dinosaurs as solitary creatures that ate everything in sight have changed. Some species were gregarious, they say, and had more of a social life than commonly understood.It took years of analysis and delays in publication to bring the story to press. Liu describes how this brain fossil was found back in 2004.The fossilisedm.The giant titanosaurs are surprising scientists, too.",
        "By piecing together bones from different continents, scientists are surmising that the giant beasts must have crossed Antarctica to get to Australia, National Geographic says. The BBC News explains, “This became possible because of the arrangement of the continents and changes in the global climate.” The south pole’s continent was not covered in ice back then.",
        "Scientific American says, “While Dinosaurs Romped, Birdsongs Filled the Air in Balmy Antarctica.” Therein lies a “huge surprise,” this article says: “Preserved among the fragile fossilized bones of this prehistoric bird there were pieces of soft tissue, specifically a section of the trachea and a series of rings that make up a syrinx.” Judging by the nature of this vocal organ, they suspect the bird could have made “the honking sounds of its living relatives,” such as ducks and geese.",
        "An artist’s rendition shows a pretty modern-looking swimmer.This research is also important because it reveals that birds such as V. iaai—which, despite having mostly terrestrial habits, could tolerate long periods underwater—were already highly specialized toward the end of the nonavian dinosaur era, when they wandered among the large creatures.",
        "“It shows that before the mass extinction that wiped out many of the dinosaurs on Earth along with two thirds of all living species, birds were already diversified,” Novas concludes. “And somehow, Vegavis managed to survive.”Now that Liu and his colleague Martin Brasier of Oxford know that the soft brains of dinosaurs can fossilize, they think paleontologists should go and search through their collections for more.The guy found this delicate brain fossil on a beach. How lucky was that?",
        "Think about 65 million years or more of continents moving and erosion in the evolutionary tale, and someone stumbles upon it just a few years ago? It makes much more sense without the obligatory millions of years.Creation investigator Dr. Carl Werner has spent decades documenting “living fossils,” animals that appear identical or nearly identical to fossils said to be many millions of years old.",
        "In conversations with radio host Bob Enyart (see kgov.com), he reveals that he has found published evidence of parrots, flamingos, sandpipers and ducks found buried with dinosaur bones. But the DOPE museums have a narrative: “the age of dinosaurs.” To maintain the narrative before the public, they play tricks with the evidence. For one, they give fossils different species names and genus names even if they look identical to modern counterparts.",
        "For another, they put the contemporary species in other wings of the museum, so that they are not pictured with the dinosaurs in the dinosaur exhibits. He has found over 80 mammals whose fossils show that they were living when dinosaurs were alive. Werner’s book and DVD are worth studying.",
        "For starters, hear him speak on one of Enyart’s radio programs from 2012.We notice also with great interest how the findings reported here show evidence of rapid burial in water before soft, delicate tissues could decay. It’s not clear if the soft tissue in the bird syrinx reported by NG was permineralized (replaced with stone), but even if not, it’s remarkable that details that small and smaller, including the tiny capillaries in the brain, would be preserved.",
        "Nothing like that happens today when an animal dies.Soft animal organs, jellyfish, and even sponge embryos (found in China), could not be preserved as fossils if they were buried “slowly” by the gradual deposition of sediments (mud) over “long ages” as proposed by the evolutionary paradigm. And now a fossilized BRAIN has been found?! Incredible! More evidence of rapid burial preserving this and the trillions of other fossils buried in sedimentary layers (i.e.",
        "Grand Canyon) found all over the earth which provide the best evidence of a global, catastrophic deluge as described in the Bible."

        "Russia's Gazprom settles Ukraine gas row, but profits could dipThe energy giant agreed Tuesday to pay 'European prices' for Central Asian gas, where it has long enjoyed below-market rates.Almaty, KazakhstanIt's been an important week for Russian energy giant Gazprom's bid to strengthen its hold on oil and gas markets.After withholding 50 percent of Ukraine's gas supplies in a brief dispute last week, Gazprom on Thursday struck a deal that cuts out middlemen and gives it more access to the ex-Soviet country's industrial gas customers.",
        "But while putting the squeeze on Ukraine, Gazprom also felt new pressure from increasingly bold Central Asian states, whose energy resources are being sought by the US, Europe, and China, as well as Russia.Facing the heightened competition, Gazprom agreed to pay European prices for gas from key energy partners Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan.",
        "Although it could result in lower revenues for Gazprom, experts say Russia has effectively bought control of Central Asian exports.\"Russia will maintain its control on gas supplies even though its profit will go down,\" says Sergey Smirnov, energy expert from the Expert Kazakhstan journal. \"All other alternative routes that are on paper today become unreal.\"The deal is likely to affect Europe most, which analysts say will face higher prices.",
        "In addition, the European Union is likely to find less receptivity now from Central Asian states for a proposed Trans-Caspian pipeline that would diversify energy supplies from Russia.\"High import prices can force Russia to raise export of its own gas,\" says Mikhail Krutikhin of Russian Energy, a consultancy firm in Moscow.Ukraine, particularly, may be in the worst situation as most of its imported gas comes through Russia from Turkmenistan, which is likely to raise its gas prices from the current $130 to $150 per 1,000 cubic meters (tcm) to $250 to $350 tcm.Russia's role as sole exporterBecause all operational pipelines in Central Asia date to the Soviet era, all gas exports go through Russia.",
        "Russia has effectively used this position to dictate prices to ex-Soviet states. Just two years ago Russia was buying Turkmen gas at $65 per tcm and sold it to European countries at $250 to 300 per tcm.Such price inequalities drove Central Asian nations to seek alternative gas export routes – a task not difficult when China and the West were looking to diversify energy supplies away from Russia and the Middle East.."

        "On Mar. 21, the American Medical Association (AMA), along with dozens of other industry leaders, delivered an open letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), asking for an Administrative Burden category for exemptions to MACRA penalties.The letter stated that current reporting programs are inadequate to keep up with the quality reporting requirements of MACRA and the 21st Century Cures Act.",
        "The signers of the letter believe that the administrative burdens of the newly implemented requirements are too overwhelming to fully comply with by Mar. 31, 2018.What are these organizations asking for?The letter specifically addresses meaningful use (MU), the physician quality reporting system (PQRS) and value-based payment modifiers (VM). In 2017, organizations need to provide a minimum amount of reporting data in order to avoid negative payment adjustments in 2019.",
        "To qualify for positive payment adjustments, organizations must meet specific reporting goals as laid out by CMS.“Oct. 2, 2017 is the deadline for starting to collect data.”Currently, organizations have until Oct. 2, 2017 to begin sending data to CMS. Reports must cover at least 90 days.",
        "Failing to submit the minimum amount of data by the 2018 deadline may result in a negative payment adjustment.“Consequently, we urge the Administration to take a series of steps to address these same challenges in MU, PQRS and VM prior to their replacement by MACRA and minimize the penalties assessed for physicians who tried to participate in these programs,” stated the letter.Physicians lacking the necessary reporting systems struggle to produce reports that meet CMS standards, increasing the risk of future penalties.CMS has yet to formally respond to the request for an Administrative Burden exemption.How can organizations make reporting improvements today?Unfortunately, organizations cannot wait long for a response.",
        "Time is rapidly ticking down to the Oct. 2 deadline for beginning the reporting process. Waiting for an exemption that may never come will only drive up risk. Organizations with thin profit margins cannot face that kind of risk, which means it’s time to start developing a plan of action.Investing in reporting solutions today could help organizations avoid Medicare penalties in the future.",
        "The formula is simple:Improve your reporting platform today, protect – and possibly augment – your revenue in 2019.If you’re worried about future penalties, the easiest step to take is to find an affordable way to submit the bare minimum reporting data in 2017.",
        "According to CMS, providing 90 days of data for a single quality measure or improvement activity is enough to avoid penalties and may even garner a positive adjustment.Example: Care transition documentation practice improvementsOne of the many improvement activities organizations may submit data for is improving documentation of care transition. This activity requires MIPS-qualified providers to document how they carried out a patient-centered action plan for the first 30 days following a discharge.",
        "These activities may include phone calls, home visits and providing patients information.Organizations with customized technology solutions can complete this task easily by pulling data from a patient engagement system into a report they would then forward to CMS. Doing so not only helps organizations avoid penalties, but also improves patient engagement.Even if CMS implements the Administrative Burden, the exemption wouldn’t stop penalization – it would only push penalties back further.",
        "The best solution is to invest in reporting solutions today so that you can get the highest positive payment adjustment in the future. By 2022, organizations stand to gain up to a 9 percent increase in payment adjustments from CMS."

Rewatching Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol the other day, I couldn't help but wonder why it was revealed that Hendriks went to the meeting in the Burj Khalifa with a mask on. It was established that Wistrom, his right-hand man and choice for the disguise, hadn't met their contact, Moreau, otherwise the duped meeting with the M:I squad wouldn't have worked.",
        "Surely Hendriks knew that, so why disguise himself as Wistrom?I can understand Hendriks perhaps not wanting to wander around without a disguise, because of his high profile status. I can almost understand him not wanting to send Wistrom to the meeting unsupervised, because of the high stakes in what was involved, although you'd think he'd trust his right-hand man more.",
        "But if you are Hendriks wanting to make sure you got the right materials, weren't double-crossed, and weren't recognised, why disguise yourself as your known accomplice? Wistrom essentially attracted just as much attention as Hendriks.It would have made more sense for Hendriks to turn up wearing a completely neutral disguise, because he wouldn't have been tracked and Moreau wouldn't have noticed.",
        "Or wear a neutral disguise and pretend to be Wistrom's right-hand man for the deal, to be there, be represented, and still go unnoticed. It seems that the reveal of the mask was there solely to have one used in a manner that didn't spoil the plot by being entirely overused, as in M:I 2, and tucked away at the end of an action sequence in the hopes of its not making any sense going unnoticed.",
        "Maybe I'm missing something.Two anomalies are cleared of Sleepers, and their wrecks are looted and salvaged to bring back a fair 170 Miskies of plunder. That's not bad. The first anomaly even had my Golem not sitting in a blinding fog bank, letting me enjoy the view. It was almost a pleasant experience.",
        "Now to poke our neighbouring class 3 w-space system in my Proteus strategic cruiser, see what's happening in today's local constellation.Jumping to C3a has my directional scanner showing me nothing, although opening the system map and seeing just how much space there is between the planets makes the negative result less surprising. One planet is in range, and the system is 125 AU across.",
        "There doesn't look to be much too see overall, which there isn't, but the eight anomalies and six signatures are spread over so much volume that it feels like less. I launch probes and perform a blanket scan to see if I can add any ships to the signatures, and I can't. There aren't even any structures, none at all, so the system is unoccupied.I scan. Gas, wormhole, wormhole, relics, and a wormhole.",
        "There's a lot of space between our K162 and the wormholes, and as there's no occupation to watch I am in warp to each connection as soon as it is resolved. A K162 from class 4 w-space could be interesting, the static exit to low-sec obviously leads to Domain, and a K162 from class 2 w-space would be much more attractive if it weren't at the end of its life.",
        "Never mind, I pop out to Domain to bookmark the K162 in low-sec, duly noting the three extra signatures should I need more to scan, then back to C3a and across to see what's waiting for me in C4a.My goodness, it's the nexus of w-space: J100001. Naturally, there is a tower lacking ships visible on d-scan, and although a big cluster of green highlights fourteen anomalies there are only two signatures present. Maybe the other one is a K162.",
        "I warp away from the wormhole and tower, launch probes, and blanket the system. Nope, the other signature is weak, clearly not a K162. Curious, and because it's just one, I identify the signature as gas. There's nothing else to do in this system, and I head back to low-sec to see what the signatures are there. Back through a now-dying C247 to C3a, a clear indication that I'm hours late to whatever activity there might have been.Three extra signatures in low-sec, three wormholes resolved.",
        "I warp to the first, wondering how many will be a result of the explosion of empire-empire connections tonight, and drop out of warp next to, huh, another K162 from deadly class 6 w-space. These seem more frequent too. The second wormhole is an N944 to more low-sec, leading to Essence from the colours, and relatively useless. The last is a K162 from class 5 w-space.",
        "Not great options, but I work with what I've got.In to C5a and d-scan is clear, a blanket scan revealing seventeen anomalies and ten signatures. Again there are no ships and no structures. I've done enough here. Back to low-sec, across to the other K162, and in to C6a. D-scan is clear, and I have to page my way through fifty-six anomalies to see the fourteen signatures, lack of ships, and sole structure somewhere in the system. That ain't no on-line tower. I'm not finding anything tonight, it seems.",

        "My rating: 3 of 5 starsI bought this because of all the great reviews. I guess I'm just not a sweet romance type of person. I enjoyed it, I really did - it kept me reading. I didn't have to sit and finish it all in one sitting, however. Once Anna and T.J. got back to the real world, the story stalled a little for me. Then it picked up, and the ending was sufficiently fulfilling.I enjoyed their time on the island - the struggles to survive, their triumphs and heartaches. I loved watching T.J.",
        "grow and how they began to see each other as more than just survival companions.Maybe because Anna is so close to my age - I knew what she would do. I knew what she was thinking when they got back to Chicago. I saw it all coming. But it didn't bother me.The funny thing is- the writing style is very on-the-surface. The reader does not get much insight to what the characters are thinking, even though the chapters switch between Anna's and T.J.'s POV. It's more like reading a narration of the events.",
        "So, all the emotion is brought out in dialogue and by the narrator's observations of the other. I really enjoyed their conversations. T.J. is awesome, I just really liked him.All in all, I enjoyed this one. I didn't love it, I probably won't read it again.",
        "But it was a sweet romance.View all my reviewsWhen a book makes me cry, when it makes me feel as if something heavy is sitting on my chest or weighing on my mind, when characters make me sit and think about them long after I've finished their story, I have to give that book 5 stars.",
        "Given all the excellent reviews for On the Island, I was expecting that I would like this book, that it would be a good read for me as well, but I did not expect to end up caring, or even crying (probably more like actually bawling at times).",
        "Just now, after having finished the book, I'm still thinking about Anna and TJ.You know what happens in this story: a tutor and her young student are stranded all alone on a tropical island, basic premise with a basic theme, but this is more than just an older woman/younger man romance. For that matter, it's more than just a romance.",
        "It's a story about survival, about facing life and death, about longing, but most of all, it's about a true love, something deeper and which stretches beyond romance and those strong but maybe superficial feelings of desire and want. These are two characters who actually put the needs of a lover before want and desire."

        "If this wasn’t a WTF moment in art history then I don’t know what was.Sick of playing by the rules, Picasso just went for it in Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon), and quite literally changed the face of painting as we knew it. Folks say this painting hails the advent of modern art, which is probably why it is one of the most visited painting at the MoMA.These odd looking ladies stare out at us from a brothel window in a very “whatchu lookin’ at?” kind of way.",
        "The frank, direct gaze of Manet’s Olympia and how she makes the viewer uncomfortable may have inspired Picasso, but these prostitutes make Olympia look run of the mill. The art world was shocked by Picasso’s total dismissal of those little things taught in art school like perspective, anatomy, scale, yadda-yadda-yadda. But for real, what is going on in this painting? Is that woman on the right peeking out of curtains behind everyone else or on the same visual plane?",
        "Are the two figures in the center standing up or lying down? And I can’t even start with the squatting figure that looks like she's doing her best The Excorcist impression.Before this painting, Picasso was stuck in his Rose period and playing it quite safe. And then suddenly – there was this. It was like shards of glass had exploded all over the canvas and left these jagged ladies behind.",
        "Originally, in the sketches, there was a man holding a book in the painting too, but he was left out of the final composition. And a good thing, too. Because girl power is going strong here. Even though the ladies look like they’re posing in the display case of a shop window, they seem completely unapologetic. They appear unaware of the fact that their faces are nothing like the ones you’d see on earlier nudes. They’re just not pretty.",
        "In fact, Picasso drew inspiration from Iberian and African masks he’d seen at an exhibition at the Louvre, something that is pretty obvious when you look at both the chicks on the right. Other inspirations: Matisse, Gauguin, El Greco, and Cezanne.One of the curators from the MoMA talks about how Picasso was afraid of contracting syphilis from these working girls, whose faces might be showing some symptoms of the STD.",
        "And that apprehension may be reflected in the uneasiness that the viewer feels when these women stare back. Because, let’s not forget, the very first viewer was Picasso and it's his anxiety that we’re indirectly feeling. It also tells us that Picasso liked to party with hookers, but that shouldn't surprise anyone.Like most famous artworks, everyone obviously hated this painting when they first saw it.",
        "His buddies Braque and Matisse thought it might be some kind of terrible joke, but were intrigued by it nonetheless. The painting was originally titled The Brothel of Avignon but was changed by the curator of the exhibition in which it first raised the publics’ eyebrows. It was bought for the close to nothing price of $24,000 by MoMA in 1937.",
        "They had to pawn a Degas to raise the money for this, but I’m guessing they got their money’s worth.Here is what Wikipedia says about Les Demoiselles d'AvignonLes Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon, originally titled The Brothel of Avignon) is a large oil painting created in 1907 by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. The work, part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, portrays five nude female prostitutes in a brothel on Calle de Avinyó, a street in Barcelona.",
        "Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none is conventionally feminine. The women appear slightly menacing and are rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes. The in fact, his subsequent friendship and collaboration with Picasso led to the cubist revolution.",
        "Its resemblance to Cézanne's The Bathers, Paul Gauguin's statue Oviri and El Greco's Opening of the Fifth Seal has been widely discussed by later critics.At the time of its first exhibition in 1916, the painting was deemed immoral. The work, painted in Picasso's studio in the Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre, Paris, was seen publicly for the first time at the Salon d'Antin in July 1916, at an exhibition organized by the poet André Salmon..",
        "Picasso, who always referred to it as mon bordel (\"my brothel\"), or Le Bordel d'Avignon, never liked Salmon's title and would have instead preferred the bowdlerization Las chicas de Avignon (\"The Girls of Avignon\")."

        "Written by most of the Wayans (Keenen Ivory, Shawn, Marlon, Craig, and Damien), starring Damon Jr., and employing most everyone else in the family as caricatures ranging from insipid to amusing, the movie does just what you expect: it points out generic clichés, takes on the usual race and gender stereotypes, and provides a couple of clever asides as well, like a muttered list of colors for “loud-ass suits,” including “Flavor Flav Eyes Yellow” and “Djimon Honsou Black.”Like the Wayans’ previous genre spoofs (Don’t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, Scary Movie), Dance Flick is more a series of scenes than a movie.",
        "Thomas (Damon, Jr.) and A-Con (Affion Crockett) set up something like a plot when their crew gets served at a dance battle (run by bald, buck-toothed Keenan Ivory). Ostensibly, this means they’re desperate to win some prize money, somewhere, in order to repay a debt to Sugar Bear (David Alan Grier in a humungous fat suit). As the boys ponder their options, they spend an evening at Club Violence, where Thomas meets the new girl at Musical High School, Megan (Bush).",
        "She’s a former ballerina undone by guilt over her mother’s death following a collision with a “Cheney Oil” truck and subsequent encounters with cars featuring the license plates “Lindsay,” “Brandy,” and “Halle.” (This segment of her flashbacked backstory grants the film a chance to lampoon the current economy, with witnesses to the accident so obsessed with getting free gas that they leave her to blow up with her car.) Now stuck in squalor with her dad (Chris Elliot as Terry Kinney), Megan seeks a way to express herself.",
        "How lucky that she finds a new self to express.As in Save the Last Dance, Thomas teaches Megan to dance “hiphop” while his sister, Charity (Essence Atkins), instructs her in “black” dress and affect. A single mom who brings her baby to school (parking him in her locker during classes), Charity explains that she hangs out with Keloid (Sufe Bradshaw) and Uglisha (Yves Lola St. Vil) because they make her look good by comparison.",
        "It’s not a bad point to make regarding the ways high school movies organize their supporting casts, but it’s hardly news. Neither is the walking gag of a dance teacher, Ms. Cameltoé (Amy Sedaris), or the principal, Ms.",
        "Dontwannabebothered (Kim Wayans), whose names suffice to describe their brief functions here (that said, Wayans’ little twirlaway move in the school hallway and up the stairs is rather perfectly weird).These and other parodies come fast and furious: mean girl Nora (Christina Murphy), blind student Ray (George Gore II), flaming Jack (Brennan Hillard) (who sings, to the tune of Fame‘s “I Wanna Live Forever,” “I will be gay forever!”), and big-haired Tracy Transfat (Chelsea Makela), who somehow can’t see just how gay Jack is.",
        "While the efforts are energetic, the effects are hit and miss. In part this is a problem in the premise: the films under attack—like hood movies, slasher films, “white chick” rom-coms—are essentially and self-confessedly cliché machines in their first incarnations. And so, piling on with parody mostly seems less clever than unoriginal (see Fox’s Glee for wittier, less dated versions of the same jokes).The question posed by Mr. Moody is thus exactly right and deeply irrelevant.",
        "The quick-cut close-ups of Thomas’ leotarded body parts during a lazy evocation of Flashdance don’t precisely mean he’s giving up his manhood or keeping his dignity and integrity either. Instead, Dance Flick delivers what you know it will—fat jokes, dead parent jokes, gay jokes, race jokes, girl jokes, and boy jokes. The comedy is trivial, the formula mundane, and the full-employment opportunities for the Wayans impressive. It can’t be surprising that the movie is unsurprising.Rating:"

        "Sorry for the late post, been busy all weekend. I had the pleasure of fishing with Gary (Imnaha), for some steelhead on Friday. We got up to the fishery around 7am and were suprised by the lack of trailors....Either that was a GOOD thing, or a BAD thing...",
        "yet to be determined...We decided to head upriver past some recognizable landmarks, such as Beacon Rock,and made our way to a secret locale we clever named the 'shad rack'We anchored in 15' of water, put back a U20, and some spin-n-glos/shrimp combos.first bite was on Gary's rode. The thing starts fighting more like a summer nook than a steelhead. larger with the long, pulling headshakes. Didn't fight like a sturgeon...but it was. Nice sized fish too, almost keeper size.",
        "Safely released and back to the deep depths of 15'.Around 9 or so, my rod buries. safe to say this fish is hooked good. The fish rockets straight out of the water with three or four great acrobatic jumps. After her show was over, I grinded her up to the boat, to notice no extra fins.BONK BONK! (Didn't take much for a 6 lb fish)\"Hey, look at the holdover trout I caught up here at the lake!\" is what I felt like saying holding it up....just seemed so tiny compared to salmon/tuna/halibut as of recently.",
        "But still great fun, don't get me wrong!~ Sometimes its good to scale down..",
        "Its like tying on a #18 caddis to a 4wt and hittin a small creek the day after bloodying the boat with tuna 35 miles out on the Big Blue.....Brings things into check.Meanwhile, absorbing the rays of the sun, Gary is brought to his feet by another good bite later that we KNEW was a sturgeon the minute it started poking at his rod.Another good healthy legal-sized fish.Again, popped the hook out and let it swim on back to scavenge on something dead.We made sure to keep the prawn rig up further off the bottom but with their good sniffers, they still seemed to find it.One random thing I thought was kinda ironic is that the sturgeon both came on the inside rod, and on the bait that was higher up in the water column..",
        "and the steelhead came on the outside rod, deeper water.Turned out to be a great day on the water.. We ended up keeping one steelhead, and letting two 'incidental bi-catch' (trying my gillnet terminology) sturgeon back to grow larger and maybe keep, another day.Hope to get up there again.. Just watching the osprey dive for fish, the herons fight for fishing grounds, even the other fishermen attempting to anchor, made for some great entertainment!"

        "- SMRToy Review - Danger Mouse Action Figures and More!You’re going to want to read my review for the re-vamped Danger Mouse series on Netflix before going any further.All done?Good. So, having read that [You didn’t, did you? Of course not, it’s the age of the tweet after all, TL;DR. – Ed.], you should know that I’m a huge fan of the Danger Mouse.",
        "While I certainly didn’t think about it during the run of the old show…and come to think of it, it really didn’t occur to me while I was binge watching the new series either…but around the time I finished my review, I got to thinking…were there any toys associated with this children’s TV program. I mean, anymore, there are ALWAYS toys. So, in a seemingly random mad dash to Amazon, I sought the answer.And Jazwares heeded the call. Yes, there are indeed toys.",
        "That leads us to the next question: Are they any good? I can answer with a resounding ‘mostly’.Let’s get the big negative out of the way first…they’re small, with Danger Mouse being the tallest at 3.5 inches and Penfold the shortest at 3 inches even (and Baron Von Greenback somewhere between the two).",
        "And, in what appears to be a trend amongst toys from British properties (cough*DoctorWhoActionFigures*cough), it’s a scale that really doesn’t fit in well with any other line you might be collecting. It’s certainly not a deal breaker for me…but many action figure collectors do indeed concern themselves with scale.That out of the way, I have to admit that the amount of articulation they squeezed into these figures is rather impressive.",
        "As one would expect, the pinnacle of this would indeed be DM himself. Ball-jointed shoulders and hips, hinges at the elbows and knees and neck, wrist and ankle swivels…I have to admit that this is more articulation than I was expecting. Having said that, you can see that the articulation can lead to breaking up the sculpt, which, if you think about it, is certainly to be expected from an action figure based off a cartoon model…and, again, the small size we’re dealing with.",
        "Keeping those limitations in mind, it’s clear they did the best they could and honestly, I appreciate it. While it may not look great, the figures remain fun…and isn’t that the most important aspect of a toy? To continue, Penfold is a step down…but is surprising in the articulation that is present, again, given how short he is. He’s got a swivel at the neck, shoulders (so no outward arm movement from him) and waist with universal joints on his hips (which was the biggest surprise to me).",
        "Greenback proves the weakest of the three with only universal joints on his shoulders. Additionally, the packaging says you can rest Nero on his back…but it’s more of a trick of balance than anything else…certainly not a ‘feature’.Naturally, no super spy heads out into the field without his dashing sports car…so Jazwares cooked up a Mark IV Danger Car for the figures!",
        "Granted, it doesn’t do much…but it does what it needs to, that being that wings pop out for flight mode at the push of a button. Yeah, it’s neat that there’s an openable trunk (or boot since we are talking about British toys here)…but it’s too small for anything to fit in it. [So clearly DM’s agency outsourced the Mark IV’s production out to Italian supercar designers? – Ed.] You can see from the pics that the figures fit okay in it.",
        "DM seems almost slightly too tall and requires a slight bend at the knees whereas Penfold is a bit too short and thus is prone to a bit of rolling around…which, honestly, probably happens in the ‘real’ Mark IV, so maybe that’s a slavish dedication to cartoon reality as opposed to any shortcomings on the manufacturer or designer’s part. The only thing that can be a bit of a distraction though is that DM’s feet are behind the steering wheel, pressed up on the dash panel.",
        "Thankfully, the decals take that into account, putting the speedometer in a more central location as opposed to where it’s typically found. Still, it bugs me a little that there’s no place to put the feet under and thus better capture a realistic set up. Oh, and yes, the car is right side drive…so, accuracy!Lastly, we picked up three stuffed toys…again DM, Penfold and Greenback.",
        "And again, they’re a bit smaller than you’d expect…about the size of the ‘medium’ stuffed toy you’d win off a midway game at an amusement park or one of the larger items you’d find in one of those rigged claw games. The only thing to point out is that each one does have a ‘press here’ electronic gimmick that gives you three sounds/phrases.",
        "Nothing that really stands out as memorable or funny (which I can honestly say because as I write this, I cannot remember what phrases they say)…but all applicable to the characters.All in all, I have to say that while yes, die hard action figure fans or collectors will likely have issues with these toys…well, that’s just it, they’re toys. They’re fun and they’re for kids…with just enough articulation to make them interesting.",
        "If you keep that in mind and are a fan of the show, then these are definitely worth picking up. If you’re expecting what you typically get with 6 or 7 inch scale action figures…or even Playmates recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles line…you’re probably going to be disappointed.#actionfigures #cartoons #toys"

        "Then there are the accommodations themselves: your choice of a colorful stunner of a luxury cottage or a tree house.And the setting for this already-amazing scene is a bamboo forest — not off on some faraway tropical island, but in the middle of Atlanta, of all places.What’s more, the alpacas and llamas are rescues, and the tree house was built from reclaimed materials.",
        "It sounds like one heck of a retreat!I mean, come on, can you imagine waking up in the morning and seeing Figgy the llama out your window?Well, hold on.",
        "If you opt for the tree house, you’re not going to catch that view of a friendly critter right out your window, because it sits high above the forest floor on stilts.The tree house has become a huge success on Airbnb, with people renting it not just for overnight stays but weddings and other events.But Kara O’Brien, the owner of this little corner of paradise, didn’t get a lot of support for her plan at the outset. “Everyone said it was a terrible idea,” she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.",
        "“But I’m not one to really listen to other people.”The tree house is currently going for $375 per night on Airbnb, and the cottage is $134 a night. O’Brien also offers a “Llama Alpaca Experience” on Airbnb so visitors can meet the animals even if they’re not staying in the cottage or tree house.Since it’s made from reclaimed materials, the tree house has some interesting details.",
        "For example, the main entry door came from a 120-year-old house in Atlanta that once belonged to the mayor:The cottage is really charming, too.It’s not among the bamboo, but it’s on the farm, so you’re adjacent to all of the llama and alpaca action:In a video the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shared about the Airbnb units, O’Brien talks about how the tree house has brought people together in surprising ways.“We’ve had proposals and weddings — it seems like it’s a place where people have come together, and celebrate each other and are really happy, and that was something we didn’t expect when we started it.”The llamas and alpacas are in the video, too, so you should definitely watch:O’Brien notes in the video that the bamboo forest’s origins are a bit of a mystery, but people think it’s been there since the 1940s.Really, a hint of mystery just adds to the allure of this place.That and baby llamas.One of O’Brien’s Instagram captions sums it up.",

        "Signor Sassi is a London institution that has been around since 1984, from 2007 the ownership belonged to the San Carlo Group. It ruffles up the sort of Italian food that ‘Mama’ used to make, comforting, simple, classic, wholesome and above all pretty damn tasty. Format wise, there are two narrow dining spaces as you walk in, warmly hued with dimmed lights, white table clothes, tiled floors and walls peppered with ‘A’ to ‘Z’ listed celeb’s photos.",
        "It’s a vibrant place full of well heeled folk, with suited waiters buzzing around, navigating through the tapered gaps between tables, doing their thing. If you’re lucky, they’ll congregate and sing you a melody!",
        "You might get better Italian fare elsewhere, but this London institution tucked away in Knightsbridge Green is worth checking out.The walls are decorated with famous faces who have dined here.Looks like quite a few well heeled folk eat here.What better way is there to start a meal than bread? I tried the brown variety – not making me want to go back for seconds but it was decent enough.",
        "It’s complimentary as is the parmesan and olives.There is something about this parmesan that makes me keep going back for more – your mouth is filled with its savoury umami nuttiness – it was simply addictive.These olives are beautiful to look at and to taste – I preferred the green ones.The menus are extensive to say the least, they are split across the ‘specials’ which has more dishes than a John Lewis department store.",
        "There’s also their standard menu, the ‘chefs specials’ and your obligatory ‘in season’ truffle menu.There’s even a bit of Kobe in their chef’s specials – I’m not sure how legit their license is!Every day we’re trufflin’!Things were kicked off with this Primitivo Di Manduria – it was very juicy, full bodied with a long finish.Tomato Bruschetta also complimentary and a very tasty appetiser.",
        "The biscuit-like toasted bread was the perfect vehicle to carry those sweet chopped tomatoes, which are seasoned with basil and olive oil.Gamberoni Gorgonzola (£12.95). Yes that’s right, tiger prawns with gorgonzola cheese. The prawns were cooked beautifully, translucent and juicy. However, the dish belongs in the weird pile for me. Cheese is just a plain ‘NO’ with prawns, and that Thai style sweet chilli sauce only adds to the clash.Zitonni Toscanini (£14.80).",
        "‘Long pasta tubes, favourite of the Maestro Toscanini, made with Tuscan spiced sausage, extra virgin olive oil, fresh tomatoes & Tuscan percorino’. This dish was designed to be eaten with a full bodied Italian red, there’s definitely not delicate flavour here – you get the sharp tang of the tomatoes and the robust smokey spicy sausage, all nestled into those al dente tubes of deliciousness. My slight quibble though is that the presentation could have been tighter.Spaghetti lobster (£26).",
        "Sweet, sweet lobster at one with the al dente spaghetti. Cooking with the shell, is obviously conducive of more flavour too. It’s a winner. My only gripe is that at a £26 price point there needs to be more lobster.Capesante al forno (£23.50). Fresh scallops drizzled with lemon, olive oil, parsley, garlic. Baked with bread crumbs. I didn’t get to taste this one sadly.Abbacchio Lagure (£17.90). Baked rack of lamb with red wine & mixed herbs. A perfect pink in the middle and tender as can be.",
        "Visually, it was a thing to behold.Let’s not forget the sides now, as they are worthy of a mention. First up is spinach sauté (£3.35) with garlic, chilli and Worchester Sauce. Spinach can be a dark art to cook as it holds a lot of water – I mean come on let’s be honest and say who likes watery spinach? Not here though, it was pitch perfect, full of flavour and a must have.Fried courgettes (£3.35) came crisp with a light batter, just enough to cover those sweet slithers of courgette.",
        "I didn’t stop until they were all gone!An extra special mention needs to go to our maitre’d ‘Dino’. He knew the extensive menu like the back of his hand, likewise for the wines & their particular regions. His charm and slick service enhanced our meal no end.The verdict:When did I go? Nov 2015The damage: Expect to pay £65-£80 per head with wine.The good: Classic Italian cooking with old school Italian charm, Dino was on point.",
        "It’s particularly entertaining when all the waiters congregate and sing! The must haves include the lobster spaghetti (you can’t beat the classics) as are spinach and courgette sides.The bad: I was too full for desert and the menus is far too busy. Avoid the prawns with gorgonzola.Rating: 4/513-14 Knightsbridge, London SW1X 7QLPhone: 020 7584 2277"

        "In Her Own Sweet Time: One Woman's Unexpected Adventures in Finding Love, Commitment, and MotherhoodI read this book in one day. It, like the author, and like the problems she explores, is not perfect. Like the author, In Her Own Sweet Time is lovable and I eagerly devoured it for the stories she tells, the problems she outlines, and the social phenomena she identifies.The question “What is the impact of new reproductive technologies (NRTs) on feminism?\" is a recurring motif within this book.",
        "On the one hand, women have the unprecedented opportunity to choose when and how to become mothers—with a partner, with donor sperm, through intrauterine insemination, through in vitro fertilization or with the help of a surrogate. Women can freeze eggs at the peak of fertility for later use, and can freeze fertilized eggs for transplantation. Lehmann-Haupt describes all of these reproductive tools and her experience with them.",
        "I was delighted to see her go further and wonder about how they relate to feminism—its history, aims, and future. Women are ‘liberated’ to do it all and \"on our own\" (for \"on our own\" read: with an entire medical team. Ahem).",
        "The author wants to know whether is it okay—whether is it feminist—to want a partner, to desire love, and to hope for relationship and commitment.Lehmann-Haupt does unwittingly import some of the old liberal feminist zero-sum assumptions about gender, which blunts the edge of her musing on the relationship between NRTs and feminism.",
        "Here, like many 1980s feminists that argued access to abortion makes women more like men and may be problematic to feminism, Lehmann-Haupt wonders if access to NRTs makes women more like men, and so may be problematic to feminism. Both arguments claim that the procedures in question—abortion and NRTs—allow women to deny their biological nature.",
        "It’s a convoluted syllogism: women's biological nature includes motherhood; men's biological nature does not include motherhood; when women act against their biological nature to preclude motherhood they are (acting) like men.",
        "No, it's not perfect, but hey, it's not my logic.The fact that Lehmann-Haupt makes such a claim (that egg freezing allows women to deny their biological nature) now, decades past the Sex Wars of the 1980s and all of those old essentialism debates and appears unaware of the problems of this claim is noteworthy. It indicates that the question and meaning of nature is still a problem for feminism, and therefore, for American culture generally.",
        "There is still difficulty in developing a robust conception of what woman is and can be that allows for motherhood, but does not require it for \"real\" womanhood.That being said, I definitely recommend In Her Own Sweet Time.",
        "It is refreshing to read about a woman who is struggling with questions about commitment, love, motherhood, technology, and feminism, and who is able to live with those struggles, say imperfect (but often very good) things, go on safari, travel with friends, date and cope with disappointment, and take her own sweet time with all of it.Post new comment"

There seems but little doubt that a first-class prize fight will take place near this city within the next 12 or 24 hours.",
        "The city is filling with sporting men, who are attracted by the positive knowledge that Joe Goss and Paddy Ryan are in town, and that they will fight before to- morrow's sunset. Those in the best position to give particulars concerning this event are extremely reticent, particularly when questioned by newspaper men.",
        "Very few of the fraternity are certain when and where this mill will take place, but a general canvass fixes the time to-morrow morning, and the place as Collier's Station, on the Panhandle road, and within a short distance of the State line between this State and West Virginia.The presence here of the principals in the coming fight increases the prevailing interest.",
        "Paddy Ryan has for some time been in training at Fairchild's, five miles out the Perrysville road, and has been actively preparing for to-morrow's event. Ryan is 28 years of age and six foot one inches in height, weight 160 pounds. He has never fought in the prize ring. His trainer is Johnny Roach. Joe Goss, who has been in training at Port Hamilton, N. Y., reached this city this morning from the East, via Cincinnati Express on the Pennsylvania railroad, at 8:11.",
        "He was accompanied by his trainer and by Billy Tracey, his backer. The men attracted a good deal of attention.Goss was neatly dressed in dark clothes. He is an Englishman by birth, is forty-four years old, and stands five feet eight inches in height and his fighting weight is placed at 150 pounds. He entered the prize ring in 1859, and has taken part in many famous battles. It is claimed that he has deteriorated in condition and is scarcely a match for Ryan.",
        "After Goss had walked the length of the Union Depot he was hurried into a carriage that stood in waiting and was driven out of the eager crowd. A continuance of the present, delightful weather will tend to increase the assured big attendance at this mill.In regard to the proposed fight Chief of Police Pender says that he is determined it shall not take place in this county, and he will use every means in his power to this end.",
        "He has had an eye on the principals all day, but has been unable to hear anything definite concerning their plans. Of course, if the battle takes place outside of Allegheny county, as in all probability it will, it will be impossible for him to interfere, and none of the parties can bee arrested until they have actually violated the law.This afternoon it was learned that Joe Goss quarters at or near McKee's Rocks.",
        "The pugilist was sent for by Mayor In(?)dell, and was told that he must fight outside of Allegheny county. The pugilist and his friends assured the Mayor that the trouble would take place outside. Arthur Chambers, one of the party, stated that the fight would take place outside the State.Sports"

Here are a few of the ideas I've been using to modernize the codebase.Remove private method declarations and use class extensions to add ivars.First to get chopped by the deletion button are private method declarations.",
        "After Xcode 4.2 came out we took to using the class extension feature to add private method declarations at the top of implementation files. This was a nice way of keeping private methods out of the header files. Now that the compiler will check for pre-existing method signatures within the same object there's no need to define their interfaces.Occasionally it's necessary for subclass to know about private methods defined by its superclass, so we use a shared category to let them know what they respond to.",
        "Like Apple, we also quit using@private in header files.Ivars now should go in class extensions, and be prefixed by an underscore. Apple advises that you don't use method names with underscores but encourage underscored variable names.",
        "This also can free up method parameters from having ugly names such as anArtwork or aString.Use object literals when possible.Object literals are ways of adding syntacitcal sugar to the Objective-C language, they let you access keys and values easily onNSDictionarys and objects inNSArrays. There's no reason to not be using them if you're supporting iOS 4 and above. It's simple a matter of_artworks[2] vs[_artworks objectAtIndex:2].Dot syntax is OK for non-properties.OK so, I admit it.",
        "I whined when properties came out. It was back in 2007 and the Objective-C was ranked 40th in the world, it's now ranked 3nd most popular programming language. Within timeframe, my opinion on the subject of properties changed also.Originally when properties came out they exclusively were given the right to use dot notation on objects. This makes sense as they were created to provide public access to ivars which normally you can only access internally using the dot notation.",
        "With Xcode 4.3, that also changed. Now, if a method doesn't have any arguments it can be called using dot notation. I'm in favour of using this. For me a good rule of thumb has been if a method returns something, dot notation is OK. For example,_artworksArray.count is fine whilst_parsingOperation.stop isn't.Keep external code out of your project.External, or vendored code should be kept out of the main body of your code. You can use CocoaPods to keep all that code in check and up-to-date.",
        "CocoaPods is a project that aims to be what bundler does for ruby projects, or npm for node. It will deal with your dependancies whilst you can concentrate on your own code. It will create a seperate Xcode project that handles all you dependancies leaving your project only as your own code.Use umbrella imports.To try and keep the amount of noise we have at the top of our implementation files we have started to reduce the number of#import \"ARModel.h\" lines we use.",
        "By creating aModels.h file and having that include all the models it means we can still have a look through the#imports at the top to get an idea of the connections between the objects as that will only show the important imports. These can optionally be moved into your precompiled header files.Keep your code clean.Whitespace can and does slowly accumulate at the line-endings of your code.",
        "You should make sure that the new preference for automatically trimming whitespace is turned on in the text editing section of Xcode's preferences.IBOutlets should probably go in your class extensions.With modern versions of Xcode, it doesn't matter that your IBOutlets are defined in places other than in headers.",
        "As Objective-C developers, we've come a long way from having to repeatedly drag a .h from Xcode to Interface Builder, so maybe it's time to rethink the idea that our interface outlets should be publicly accessible. My opinion is that a controller's views are for the most part a private affair and that if you want to expose their functionality you do it through custom methods in the controller.",
        "There are some downsides to this, in that initially you have to change to the implementation file when using hybrid view when connecting them.These decisions have come from internal discussions and from watching many WWDC sessions on the topic. We highly recommend watching the following WWDC sessions.WWDC 2011: 105 Polishing Your App, 112 Writing Easy To Change Code and 322 - Objective-C Advancements in Depth.WWDC 2012: 405 Modern Objective-C and 413 Migrating to Modern Objective-C"

        "History of GoldWhile gold was once closely associated with money and frequently used as currency, World War II sparked change in the developed world. At this time, the Bretton Woods system was introduced, although it ceased in 1971 in response to the United States ending its gold standard.",
        "The history of gold can therefore be broken up into two distinct periods: the Classical Gold Standard, and the newer exchange rate system.The Classical Gold StandardTraditionally, under the classical gold standard, each country would assign an agreed amount of gold to a fixed value of local currency. This meant that gold could be converted into currency, and vice versa, and could be imported and exported freely.",
        "It was not unusual to see gold coins and local currencies being handled interchangeably.This system was introduced in the 1870s, and was initially used only in the UK, along with selected British colonies. Portugal became the second nation to use the Classical Gold Standard, followed by Germany. Most countries had adopted the system by 1900, with the exception of China, and some nations within Central America.",
        "It was generally agreed that the system could be paused in times of crisis, and reinstated as necessary. Overall, the system was designed to show countries were dedicated to price stability. It ceased being used in 1914, when the First World War erupted.",
        "Following the war, the Classical Gold Standard shows signs of being resurrected a couple of times but it never returned to its 1900 peak and was retired for good after the Great Depression of the 1930s.One of the reasons the Gold Standard was so popular was its inherent simplicity – the currency of any given nation was linked to gold.",
        "International settlements were made in gold, with payments surplus balances triggering an influx of gold and deficits giving rise to an outflow.While simple on the surface, this arrangement was more complicated in practise as it could be impacted by external influences, such as actions of the central banks raising interest rates or increasing the amount of money in circulation.",
        "Interest rates would also levy changes with (just as we see today) an increase in interest rates making borrowing more expensive but attract investment from overseas, which would in turn improve the balance of payment.There was an expectation of course that central banks using the Gold Standard would all adhere to an understood set of rules such as maintaining fixed prices, allowing the free exchange of gold and take measures such as suspending the Standard in times of war.While the system generally worked, not all countries followed the so called “rules of the game” at all times, with some central banks known to have manipulated the Standard to increase or decrease the cost of import and export of gold.The Bretton Woods SystemFollowing the end of World War II, a new system to replace the Classical Gold Standard was required.",
        "The Bretton Woods System was proposed in 1944, tying the US Dollar to gold at $35 per ounce. This was the only currency to be assigned a fixed gold value, with other currencies maintaining a variable exchange rate against the USD.While the system looked promising to begin with thanks to its promise of stability, fixed exchange rates and capital controls, it did begin to falter in the 1960s when the $35 fixed value became unsuitable in real terms.",
        "Devaluing the Dollar against gold was an idea that was not met with mutual agreement, especially as it would have required other countries to adjust their exchange rates too.",
        "There were wider factors at play at the time, with inflation rising and the cost of gold falling, a significant US trade deficit and a discord between economic growth and gold reserves.While the London Gold Pool, which came to be in 1961 and saw several countries pool their reserves, was successful in preventing value changes from taking place, it could not stop the launch of the two-tier system with a more flexible private market.",
        "The system ended in 1971 allowing gold to be traded freely thereafter.Cultural SignificanceThe rich history of gold is also deeply rooted in cultural significance, having been admired as one of the most stunning and mesmerising of precious metals for hundreds of years. Its unique reddish-yellow colour is believed by some cultures to represent the sun, making gold one of the most popular metals for jewellery all around the world."

The highest earning 1% in the UK pay an estimated 28% of all income tax – not the total “tax burden”. This is close to a record level, but it isn’t quite the highest percentage ever..",
        "This is close to a record level, but it isn’t quite the highest percentage ever – the top 1% paid an estimated 29% in 2015/16.There aren’t any readily available figures for what proportion of all taxes the top 1% pays.",
        "Information is available on how much income tax the top 1% of earners pay from HM Revenue and Customs, but only stretching back to 1999.The top 1% are paying a greater share of total income taxThe top 1% are projected to pay about 28% of income tax in 2017/18, so Theresa May’s claim would be roughly correct if talking just about this. The same figures though show top earners paid slightly more in 2015/16, at about 29% of income taxes.",
        "So it’s not correct to say this is a record percentage, in any case.The last few years have still seen a high proportion of income taxes paid by the top 1%, by historical standards. Since 1999 the percentage the top 1% of earners pay in income tax has risen in an almost consistent trend, across Labour, Coalition, and Conservative Governments.",

Over three-quarters of the Government’s income comes from other taxes.",
        "So Theresa May’s claim is incorrect when considering all government taxes.There are direct taxes, such as Council Tax, and National Insurance contributions. There are also indirect taxes, such as VAT, Tobacco and Alcohol Duty, and Corporation Tax.It is much more difficult to say what percentage of these other taxes the top 1% of earners pay. Households earning the top 10% of incomes pay about 27% in total of most direct and indirect taxes, according to Office of National Statistics (ONS) data.",
        "This figure has remained roughly constant since 2009/10.These numbers at least indicate that the top 1% of households would be paying a smaller fraction of total taxes than 27%, so Mrs May’s claim is unlikely to be correct for the government’s total tax take.Isn't it nice to have the whole picture?We rely on your donations to continue and grow our factchecking efforts - to help us maintain our independence we need 1000 donors to give £10 a month.

        "also “under the Law,” Rom 2:12; 3:19; 6:14; Gal 3:10; 3:23; 4:21; 5:18).→ The Christian’s relationship to the Law is therefore “dead” because his sin is forgiven and Christ’s righteousness is imputed. He is not justified or sanctified by the Law but by Christ.3.",
        "The Christian’s Rest in Jesus Christ, 8→ Every transgression the Law identified and condemned is “paid in full” by Jesus Christ, so that “there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.”1) Through the Spirit believers enjoy justification, 8:1-11• Believers in Christ through the Spirit are freed from the Law’s condemnation of sin, being justified on the basis of Christ’s sacrifice, 8:1-4• Unbelievers cannot please God because the sin nature controls them and they are enemies of God, 8:5-8.• Through the Spirit Christians are alive in Christ because of His righteousness, 8:9-112) Believers must participate in the Spirit’s sanctifying work, as He confirms they are God’s children, 8:12-173) The Spirit guarantees believers’ glorification in fulfillment of God’s gracious purpose, 8:18-30• No matter what trouble believers experience now, through the Spirit their hope/yearning expectation is not for this world/life/now, but for eternity, 8:28-27• Believers’ confidence in eternal glory despite present troubles lies with God’s sovereign, gracious purpose to save them, 8:28-304) Believers have absolute confidence in God through Jesus Christ, 8:31-39• No charge can be made to “stick” against believers, 8:31-34• Nothing can separate believers from the love of God in the Lord Jesus Christ, 8:35-39"

Such is the popularity of cycling that some of the new words added to the Oxford Dictionary Online this May were bike-related, including sportive and its Italian brother, gran fondo.",
        "So to further get you in the mood, why not strap on that helmet, shave those legs, and let us embark on a Tour de la langue du cyclisme.Le véloFirst things first, we will need a trusty steed to ride upon. The Oxford English Dictionary’s first recorded use for the term bicycle is from 1868, according to current research.",
        "It originally referred to a kind of two-wheeled velocipede (from Latin velox, meaning ‘swift’, and pes, meaning ‘foot’), with pedals fitted directly to the slightly larger front wheel. Bicycle was more generally used in the 1870s for the high-wheeled ordinary or penny farthing, which, having solid rubber tyres and one very large wheel at the front, was more comfortable than the velocipede with its iron tyres, and required less effort to achieve faster speeds.",
        "The low-wheeled safety bicycle, similar in design to most bicycles today – with two equal-sized wheels, a diamond-shaped frame, chain-driven rear wheel, and pneumatic tyres – followed in the late 1870s and led to a huge worldwide boom in cycling.L’équipeOnce you’ve got a bike, these days preferably made of lightweight materials such as carbon fibre or chromoly, you need a team, or équipe, around you.",
        "The Tour de France features twenty-two teams of nine men, each team featuring one captain and eight domestiques. A domestique, literally translating from French as ‘servant’, is a support rider. Their main aim is to protect the captain from the competition, and help him reserve as much energy as possible so that it can all be used at the vital moments of the race.La formationWhen are cyclists like geese? No it’s nothing to do with their thighs, it’s the way they both travel in echelon formation.",
        "Echelon comes from the French word for ladder, and was originally used as a military term referring to the formation of troops. In geology if something is en echelon it is in approximately parallel formation at an oblique angle to a particular direction; in French literally meaning ‘in rung formation’. Coming back to cycling, in simple terms it means that the riders position themselves in a ‘v’ shape, just like when geese fly together.",
        "The riders in the echelon will rotate through from the sheltered side to the front and then pull off back on the windward side, this method being the most efficient way of using the group’s energy to cut through the wind and maintain a high average speed.La rapiditéWe’re powering along in echelon formation, but why does someone keep shouting ‘cadence!’?",
        "The word originates in late Middle English, meaning ‘rhythm or metrical beat’, and comes via Old French from Italian cadenza, which in its turn is based on Latin cadere meaning ‘to fall’. In cycling it refers to pedal rhythm, measured by the number of revolutions of the crank per minute.",
        "The optimal cycling cadence should perfectly balance power with endurance.Le pelotonOptimal cycling cadence is achieved, riding en echelon is helping us to cope with the crosswinds, and we have found ourselves in the leading group, known as the peloton. The word has had an interesting journey: in fifteenth-century France peloton meant little ball, especially of thread.",
        "By 1616 it referred to a small body of soldiers, by 1855 it referred to a group of sporting competitors, and then by 1884 it began to refer specifically to cycling.La fatigueThe only thing that can stop us now is if we bonk. I’ll leave you to make your own jokes. While runners hit the wall, cyclists bonk. It refers to a state of utter exhaustion, and can leave riders feeling weak and giddy.La victoireIf we manage not to bonk, we may be in line for one of les maillots, the famous jerseys.",
        "The maillot jaune, or yellow jersey, is the most famous, which is worn by the overall leader of the race. The maillot a pois is also rather fetching – the wearer of this red and white polka dot jersey is deemed ‘King of the Mountains’, the rider who has performed the best at the mountain stages.La finAs we recover at the end of the race, happy with our strong performance, our fellow riders may say “chapeau” to us.",
        "They are not complimenting us on our stylish headwear, but are indicating respect for our achievements, much like someone may doff (a Middle English contraction of ‘do off’) one’s cap.Consider your Tour de France cycling proficiency test complete. Oxford Words wishes you swiftness of foot in all your bicycling endeavours.",

        "Then 23 w/m2 is neededHave the scientists used climate sensitivity=3 to derive Radiative Forcing ?Even with Radiative Forcing, one can sense an error that is an unimaginable factor of 10climate sensitivity=3 = error -> 36 = correct (factor 12 error )Radiative Forcing 2.29=error -> 23=right (factor 10 error )Or there are thought errors here.Radiative ForcingIn a forecast where the temperature increases in the future, that energy must come fromimbalance, the so-called \"Radiative Forcing\".We calculate the surface area of the Earth, as a slice seen from the Sun, and multiply by W/m2This effect primarily warms the oceans.There, we know the volume and we can estimate the amountof stagnant bottom water that is not heated.In the calculator you can see that Climate Sensitivity=3 (as claimed by the IPCC) so the time constant RCmust be 25 years for the IPCC worldview to be consistent with NASA.Both of these figures are wrong.One can test Climate Sensitivity=40 which requires RC=720 years .",
        "Then there is harmony in the long run(VOSTOK) This is a weighty argument.More detectives are needed to solve this.",
        "Radiative forcing may become aevidential breakthrough.Here's what climate.gov says (NOAA The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration USA)You can estimate and check Radiative Forcing another way too: by looking at how fast the Earth is warming.NASA actually talks about how fast the earth is warming and this is last 5 years dTy= 0.032 C/year (=fact)The only heat that can warm the oceans is the heat that comes through Radiative Forcing.That is the imbalance in the atmosphere that comes from the greenhouse gasesAccording to NOAA, it is more than 2.29 W/m2 and the Earth is always absorbing this heat around the clock.",
        "From the sun's point of view, it is a flat disk with a radius of 637 milesNow converting everything to m and kg, the calculation of Radiative Forcing looks like this:EarthRadius m = er= 6 371 000Ocean mass kg = okg= 1 386 000 000 000 000 000 000 000Temp Change per year = dTy=0.032Specific Heat Water J/kg*deg = sHW=4200cF=okg* dTy*sHW / (pi* er^2 * 365*24*60 ) =46 w/m2NOAA calculates 2.29 but it takes 46 w/m2 just to warm the oceans.",
        "Then more is needed to melt the polar ice at the current rate.But ice is such a small part of the energy requirement that this factor can probably be ignored.Assuming that half the ocean is bottom water which absorbs no heat, cF is 23 w/m2If cF is 2.29 or 23 w/m2 ????",
        "climate experts can take many more factors into account and make a more accurate calculation using this method.In this way we are probably also approaching a point where we can dial in RC (the time constant between CO2 and real temp ) by looking at the energy balance with respect to the oceans. With a correct value of RC and a correct NASA curve 1960-2020, we lock in the climate sensitivity with great precision. (???)The calculator shows this relationship very clearly.",

Even though you have 7 to 10 days depending upon the length of your Option Period to get your Spring Texas home inspected, you want to schedule them as soon as possible.",
        "Scheduling the home inspections as soon as possible will give you time to coordinate the home inspectors schedule with yours, review the inspection report, if necessary get quotes for repairs, and negotiate repairs with the sellers all before the Option Period ends.How do you choose a home inspector? – Your buyer’s agent should be able to recommend several home inspectors.",
        "Contact a couple of the home inspectors and ask a few questions.Ask them how much they charge for the home inspection, how many homes have they inspected, what does their inspection cover, do they physically get up on the roof and inspect it, how soon will they provide you with the inspection report, and do they take photos of any problems they have identified.How much does a home inspection cost? – A mechanical and structural home inspection costs around $350 – $500.",

The findings of the Mechanical and Structural inspection may require additional inspections to be performed by licensed service providers.",
        "These additional inspections may be to further evaluate the roof, plumbing, electrical or heating and air conditioning systems.What do the home inspections cover? – A licensed home inspector is required to perform an inspection in accordance with the Standards of Practice mandated by the Texas Real Estate Commission.",

        "– the Mechanical and Structural inspection will typically take 2 to 3 hours to be performed. The Termite inspection usually takes 30 minutes and can be performed during the same time frame as the Mechanical and Structural inspection.You do not need to be present during the entire 2 to 3 hours that it will take to have the home inspected.",
        "Although I do recommend you arrive for the last 30 minutes of the inspection so the inspector can summarize his findings and you can ask clarifying questions.Your home inspector should provide you with a written inspection report usually within 2 to 3 days of the date the inspection was performed.What do you ask the sellers to repair? – it is unrealistic to ask the sellers to repair every item marked as in need of repair on the home inspection report. Why?",
        "Because the home inspector has to identify any item that does not meet building codes irregardless of whether the code was present at the time the house was built. And I have not met a homeowner turned seller yet who has brought his Spring Texas home up to meet the current year’s building codes. It is just not economically feasible.So if you don’t ask for everything to be repaired what should you focus on?",
        "As a home buyer you need to be concerned with items in need of repair that affect the health and safety of your family. For instance if the hand rail on a stairway is loose, you may want to request the seller to repair it because the instability of the hand rail could cause someone in your family to fall.",
        "I said you may want to request the seller to repair because you might be a handy person and can handle the repair yourself.By reviewing the items identified as in need of repair with your home inspector, you will be able to distinguish between the minor items you can handle yourself and the major items you need to request the seller to repair.Not all inspections have a happy ending with sellers and buyers coming to terms on repairs.",
        "Sometimes home buyers repair requests are unrealistic and sometimes home sellers think their home does not need any repairs. As a home buyer, first time or otherwise, you need to establish a walk away position on repairs. Just remember no home is perfect. The Spring Texas home you have under contract is not perfect and if you walk away the next home you find will not be perfect either.Read"

The area around the main station TerminiAt the main station in Rome there are many dubious people.",

Don´t accept a giftClose to the famous sightseeing places there are some men trying to give you bracelets, roses or something similar as a \"gift\". Don´t accept anything and don´t even talk to them. If they put it directly in your hand and do not want to take it back, just put it on the ground and keep walking.",

They recommended to buy Skip the Line Tickets for 55€, including a guided tour and the dome. Skip the Line Tickets without the guided tour are not available (not true!). The normal tickets are only 2€ cheaper (not true, the real price is 16€ for Vatican City + 6€ for the dome).",

This is how they earn their money. Therefore, don´t expect this to be free of charge.",

For example it is possible that a cappuccino costs 15€ or more. I would recommend checking out other restaurants in the area on TripAdvisor.",

        ".Medisings, aside from being a singing competition, is known for the advocacies that it is built upon. Maika Dingal of UPCM Class 2019, who is the Advocacy Head of this year’s Medisings, said that, “While Medisings is an avenue to foster class spirit, its main purpose is to support an advocacy.",
        "The greatest challenge for us was to strengthen the reach of our advocacy within UPCM and to make sure that people understood what it was actually for.”Dingal clearly remembers the story behind the advocacy of Medisings, “The decision to mobilize the youth in the community’s activities dates back to 2014.",
        "The Council for Health and Development (CHD), our partner organization, was already trying to mobilize the adults, but it was during this time that we realized that the youth have a lot of untapped potential.”This year, proceeds from this event will be provided to UP Pagsama's partner community which is Creek Drive II, Valley 8 in Parañaque to support the Youth Core Group.",
        "Youth Core Group is a group of young individuals who underwent training organized by UP Pagsama and the Council for Health and Development (CHD). The training educated the youth of the basic knowledge and skills concerning the basic common illness affecting their community and how they can manage these illnesses.",
        "The goal is to integrate the youth of the community to the continuous struggle of improving the health outcomes of Valley 8.When asked of her vision of Medisings five years from now, Dingal hopes that the advocacy will achieve sustainability, “The ultimate vision of PAGSAMA is for our organization to be no longer relevant in the communities, as we aspire for a future where all communities are empowered and all community members are active participants in the achievement of better health outcomes.",
        "We aspire for a future where PAGSAMA is no longer needed.”Ruth Eusebio, UPCM Class 2020 after singing “The Climb” originally sang by Miley Cyrus and Sweet Dreams which is one of the classic hits of Beyonce emerged as the 2017 Medisings Champion.",
        "Ruth also won the Best in Choice Piece special award along with Amor Pasigon of UPCM Class 2019.When asked how does it feel to win, Ruth answered, “I’m really happy and honoured to represent [Class 2020] since it’s a venue to inspire people through music and talent and as well to help the beneficiary of Pagsama.” Ruth also shared the inspiration behind the pieces she sang during the momentous win.",
        "“[The Climb] reminds us to keep holding on that goal that you have despite the challenges [we encounter] ahead.” She also shared that the song Sweet Dreams was also the song that she sang during her debut.Ruth dedicates her win to Class 2020, UP Pagsama and the beneficiary, her family, God and the country. When asked what is her advice for those who would also compete in Medisings, “Choose a song that you really love.",
        "And sing with all you heart,” Ruth offered.Here’s a recap of the results of this year’s Medisings:Ruth Eusebio (Class 2020) - ChampionElijah De Guzman (Class 2022) - First runner-upAmor Pasigon (Class 2019) - 2nd runner-upAmor Pasigon “Tara Tena” (Kyla feat.",

        "The seventh and final season of The Mary Tyler Moore Show is now available as a triple-DVD set. Fans of the acclaimed series are excused for scratching their heads at how long it has taken for all the shows to come out. Nevertheless, the release of the concluding 24 episodes is a welcome occasion, for this was one of the finest television programs ever.The announcement that the 1976-77 season would be the last of the series was surprising to say the least.",
        "As one of the top-rated shows of the era, the program was a virtual mint. Not only was it extremely profitable, but the writing had never been better. To many, the seventh season was the best one of the entire run.Watching these programs over 30 years after they originally aired reaffirms its reputation as one of the all-time greats. Apart from the styles, and some of the topical references, the shows have aged remarkably well. There are laugh-out-loud moments in every episode, and the jokes never pander.",
        "As is apparent to even the most casual viewer, the main characters were some of meticulously well-crafted ever.The WJM newsroom is a complex web of personalities. The leads are smart, vulnerable, and complicated - quite unlike those of most of the competition. Proving that some things never change, characters like these are as uncommon on today’s sitcoms as they were back then.Some interesting people stopped by to say hello that season. The biggest was late-night king Johnny Carson.",
        "Presumably he was attired in his trademark seventies leisure suit, but we will never know for sure. As a guest at one of Mary’s legendarily bad parties, Carson walks in just as the lights in her building go out. He says hello to everyone, then beats a hasty retreat.I was surprised to see a very young Helen Hunt as Murray’s daughter in one of the episodes. And John Amos came back as Gordy, who covered sports during the first season.",
        "He is now a high-profile network personality, and has to put up with Ted's merciless begging for a job as his co-host. Ted even offers his wife Georgette to Gordy in exchange for the gig.This was the season that Mary and Lou finally went out on a date. Talk about an impeccably written script, this one is near perfect.",
        "To be able to show the mutual attraction, their roles as colleagues, explore the idea of a romantic relationship, and resolving it all by staying “just friends” in one 22-minute program is an extraordinary display of talent.Much has been made of “The Last Show” in the 33 years since it was first broadcast. It had such an impact that it became the de facto template for the occasion of a series' end.",
        "When that time came for Seinfeld, they decided to flip the MTM format, and have regretted it ever since.With the release of the seventh season, every episode is now finally available on DVD. For this writer, The Mary Tyler Moore Show is as good as television has ever gotten, it is a series I unequivocably recommend.Article first published as DVD Review: The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete Seventh Season on Blogcritics."

These are administered by busy parents out of hours. Keeping content fresh is a challenge.Social media is becoming increasingly popular within swim clubs mostly because it’s so easy to post.",
        "Its limited search, curation and ecommerce capabilities mean that websites continue to have a role.Can publishing to WordPress be as easy as posting to social media?I’ve been researching this for a while and I think that the honest answer has been no, unfortunately.Until today maybe…Potential solutions- The WordPress App on iOS is pretty OK. Its downside is that it only allows you to operate core WordPress (posts, pages, media, etc) and not other plugins that you have installed.",
        "It’s also designed as kinda a mobile/tablet version of the full web version, which is hardly easy for people unlike us!- A Google search throws up multiple ‘listicle’ posts. They might be the ‘top 10’, but are not suitable for my customers unfortunately.- The WordPress REST API combined with other solutions such as Twilio messaging API looked possible, although would come with a significant development overhead, usage fees, and picture messaging seems to be quite country specific.",
        "A solution that works here in Australia almost certainly wouldn’t work with carriers in the US.- Part of the challenge is what to publish. Text is slow to write and often dull to read. Pictures (and increasingly video) are today’s media of choice. I wonder whether the WordPress REST API combined with a slider or gallery may do the trick. An email exchange with the wonderful Barbi at Envira Gallery’s support desk kept the innovation rolling.- And then I discovered iOS shortcuts and a solution hit me.",
        "Within a few hours I had built a working prototype!….iOS shortcuts combined with Envira Gallery are extremely powerfulMy ingredients:- WordPress website running Envira Gallery and it’s Lightroom add-on (premium plugins)- iPhone running iOS 12.1.1 and Shortcuts (free from App store)It takes only 2 steps for an iPhone user!- Take photo OR select photo from the image gallery- Press ‘share’, ‘shortcuts’ and ‘Upload’The photo is then automatically published.",
        "For sites without caching it appears immediately when the page is refreshed.Solution architecture overviewEnvira Gallery is a premium plugin that’s great for displaying photography. It’s Lightroom add-on is intended to allow professional photographers to publish direct to WordPress from within Adobe Lightroom. Without editing the plugin code I simply used the API.Shortcuts is a recently launched app that allows iOS devices to run pre-coded routines.",
        "These can be built by users using a relatively simple drag and drop style interface and very limited basic coding. Due to the feature set within Shortcuts extremely powerful functions can be built.The programmed workflow of my Shortcut is:- Select photo from the iPhone media gallery- Resize the image- Crop the image- Convert to JPEG and compress- Base64 Encode- POST to Envira Gallery APIWith a bit of fiddling I’ve configured my phone to offer the shortcut behind the standard ‘share’ icon.",
        "So publishing a photo to a gallery is literally as easy as sending a picture message!I’ll aim to share it’s file here so that you can hack. I first need to remove authentication codes etc. In the mean time here’s a quick screen grab:Caution: there are 2 ‘Base64 Encode’ values. Make sure you select the correct one in each case.URL isSecond POST Header key is: X-Envira-Lightroom-Access-TokenBuild order- Install Shortcuts on iPhone.",
        "Give it permission to access photos.- Within WordPress add a new user with sufficient permission to create Envira Galleries (Author worked for me)- Upload Envira Gallery and the Lightroom add-on- Within Envira Gallery settings, navigate to ‘Lightroom’ and create a new access token attached to the newly created user.- On the iPhone build (or install) the shortcut described above.- Insert the access code created above into the Shortcut.- Create a new Envira Gallery within WordPress.",
        "Although it will not contain images at this stage, publish. Note its number. Place the Envira shortcode (not Shortcut!) on a published post or page for testing purposes.- Insert this Envira gallery number into the Shortcut.- Test and enjoy!Known limitations- Doesn’t work on Android or old iPhones.- Upload single photos, not multiple.",
        "The latter may be possible using loops within Shortcuts.- I have not yet displayed or used Captions, Titles or set unique file names.- Cannot delete/edit from phone (must login to WordPress for that).- Works on Envira Gallery, but can’t easily find a similar solution for Soliloquy (slider)- Requires host WordPress site to be prepared for the new photo wall as described above.- Probably won’t work when phone is out of telco / WiFi network range.But wait, there’s more….!Shortcuts contains a function that can publish to WordPress direct without.",
        "It is also extremely powerful for publishing new posts, pages and uploading to the media gallery. Despite the Envira solution being more complex to implement, it creates a better user experience I think. I’ll keep experimenting.Tip: install the iOS WordPress app to populate Shortcuts with additional WordPress menu options (as yet untested by me)."

Gets complicated, but not always.One side wants Hillary in jail, and another wants Trump humiliated and massive riots if he gets elected. It is nuts. But people prefer false narratives to truth so they do not really analyze stuff. I saw a thing going around that has a very rational tone re Hillary's lack of proper handling of classified material.",
        "Reading it critically, you can see where they sidestep the issue, and actually do not refute the basic assertion of mishandling sensitive intel, but they pretend to. Most people just buy what their talking point sites say.The frustrating thing is that both sides tend to go hyperbolic instead of confining to facts without a context twist or veil.Who need to be pulled out of circulation are those who will incite violence. And it is not hard to find them.",

Because I can function on flexible hours and avoid activity and people when need be, I do OK. I cannot imagine dealing with these pruritus attacks in a jail setting, or any kind of confinement.

Greed for power can be as petty as enjoying the pain of others who do not share your worldview. Taking out bad guys is one thing. Actually enjoying their suffering is another.Which brings me to the most troubling thing I ever heard Hillary, or Trump for that matter, say; \"We came, we saw, he died. hahahahaha.\" That is really screwed up. And what we are left with as a result is even worse.",

        "Doing the OXFAM TRAILWALKER? You will want to read on. A good experience depends on it.The worldwide Oxfam Trail Walker event sees groups of 4 walkers complete a course of 100km in under 48 hours, raising money to help tackle poverty around the world.",
        "Melbourne’s turn at this incredible event is scheduled for 27th and 28th of March and this year a new course has been selected, from Churchill Park in Lysterfield to Heidelberg.Even though this is a walking event as opposed to an ultra-distance run (though people do run it), the fact that it is a walk does not mean preparation isn’t crucial. It is. You wouldn’t turn up to run a marathon on limited training or knowledge, so why would you do that when you are preparing to walk 100km?",
        "I ask that question having seen many times people do just that, and it still defies belief in my mind!!!I have volunteered as a Podiatry Supervisor a number of time and have seen all manner of foot injuries, many of which have ended a walker’s event. Most of which are preventable. Lack of preparation, prevention and knowledge are the 3 things that cause the vast majority of withdrawals from the event, and I can tell you that it is devastating to have to pull out.",
        "You start as a team, and the thought of letting those team mates down is awful. So why risk it?The 3 most common reasons people failBlisters:The most common reason people withdraw is due to blisters. On the tops of the feet, on the toes, around the heels and the arch. And not just little blisters. Think, a day in heels at the Melbourne cup blisters. X 10. They are excruciating. And they can happen early in the event if you are not prepared.",
        "Bearing in mind you will take over 300,000 steps during the event, you do not want to develop a blister at the 10 km mark because your shoes don’t fit. Or you haven’t tested your socks. Or you have a hammer toe that you hadn’t considered beforehand.There are many brands of socks on the market that claim to prevent blisters. The only way to know what works for you is to try a few different ones. The same goes with taping techniques and blisters pads like Compeed. You just have to test them out.",
        "We have tested out a number of different socks including Armaskin, Steigen and Lightfoot. The Armaskin is brilliant but it's an unusual feel under the foot and some people don't like it. Personally, I've never had a blister while wearing them though!Lack of preparationThe second reason people end the event early is through simple lack of time on their feet during training.",
        "Yes, going for a 70km walk on a Saturday isn’t particularly convenient but you need to be working towards that distance in your training. I have run a number of marathons and I always ran at least one training run of 80% of the marathon distance. You need to get the time in your legs and on your feet. It is the only way to know how your body is going to feel in the late stages of the event. There is just under 6 weeks until the event so you should be getting pretty close to your long walk.",
        "A very old rule of thumb, and one I still use is to increase your training load (so distance) by 10% a week assuming you have no injuries.",
        "I would most certainly recommend you have walked 70km at least once during your training, preferably on the trail itself.Lack of knowledgeSome questions to ask yourself:- have I tested my gear over 40km?- if you developed a blister early on, would you know how to deal with it?- what’s the best way to tape your feet to prevent rubbing and blisters?- do I know what to carry in my pack to treat any blisters?- do your shoes fit?",
        "Length, width and depth.- do you need a more supportive shoe than you normally wear, just because of the length of time you'll be on your feet? I know normally wear a LunarGlide. For the concrete parks of the course I will wear a pair of Brooks Adrenaline. I would never wear something with this much support day to day.- what type of shoes should you wear?- have a decided if I will wear runners or trail shoes, or a combination. If so, when will you change?- do you need different socks for different shoes?",
        "My trail shoes come up my ankle much higher so I needlonger socks. You don't want to find that out at 30km and not those in your packThis is all crucial information but often overlooked during the training period.So how do you make sure you are not one of the people making these mistakes? That my friend is the easiest part of your Oxfam journey.You make an appointment with our podiatrists.Simple.In an ideal world we recommend:1.",
        "Biomechanical assessment and general treatment appointmentIf you want to have this done, it needs to be done now. It is to late a fortnight out. We will check your feet and leg joints for ranges of motion and alignment to assess any potential biomechanical issues that may predispose you to injuries or blisters during training or during the event. Advise on footwear and sock choices, as well as taping techniques. All of this needs to be tested during training.",
        "It is a rookie mistake to try something untested on the day of the event (trust me, I wore 2 pairs of socks in a marathon once untested and lost 6 toenails) Advise on what to do in the event of a ‘hot spot’ or blister developing. Advise on what to carry in your pack. Complete a general treatment, removing callous and corns and properly cutting your nails2.",
        "General treatment appointment – 1 week before the event (30 mins)Complete a general treatment, removing callous and corns and properly cutting your nails so your feet are in tip top shape for the event. We recommend doing this a week prior.3. Taping appointment – 1 day before the event (30 mins)This is so you avoid having to line up at the start of the event at the taping booths and it is done in the way best suited to you.",
        "Think low stress.As a practitioner having been involved in this event over many years, it is incredibly satisfying to have clients complete the event unscathed. It is such an enormous achievement and we are privileged to be a part of the journey. Please take the time to be assessed and advised properly to give yourself the best shot at a successful event."

        "Let me present a thought experiment. Suppose the twentieth century had gone a different way. Europe is now ruled by a rejuvinated Habsburg Empire. These Austrians are America’s main compeditor for world power. The Habsburgs are aggressively Catholic; they have declared that they will use any means at their disposal, not excluding military force, to rid the world of American-sponsored evils like abortion. Suppose half of academia was Catholic and fairly obvious in their support of the Empire.",
        "Suppose crypo-Catholic movies were constantly coming out of Hollywood. Who do you think would be more inclined towards a confrontational posture towards the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the right or the left? Who would be more inclined towards negotiation or even appeasement?Sometime during the last century, the stereotype of right-wing aggressiveness became quite widespread.",
        "On the one hand, conservatives and reactionaries were supposed to be prone to violence, always eager to see war as the solution to every foreign difficulty, and filled with a murderous hatred for other countries. On the other hand, liberals, leftists, and socialists were thought to be pacifists at heart and naive in their inability to see the need for prudent self-defense.",
        "Now, it is not true that conservative beliefs logically lead to militarism; nor is it the case that liberalism logically entails pacifism. However, stereotypes don’t come from nowhere, and this one was certainly based on a legitimate observation, regardless of how it was misinterpreted. To understand it properly, we should remember who the main foreign threat was from 1945-1990 for America and the other nations that once constituted Christendom.",
        "It was, of course, the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. These countries were seen as threats partly because of their military power, but primarily because they were the bearers of a revolutionary ideology that denied our legitimacy.Communist beliefs were no secret to anybody. All the authoritative structures of the West–the patriarchal family, the Church, the nation-state, private property–were regarded as forms of oppression.",
        "They had no right to exist; in fact, it was every communist’s duty to hasten their demise. With the communists, there could be no peace, but only temporary truces, because for them we had no legitimacy. To them, we were like terrorists who have taken an airplane full of hostages. One might negotiate with the terrorists, it’s true, but only because one is forced to.",
        "However, one never imagines that the terrorists have any legitimate claim to their hostages, and one sees no obligation to negotiate in good faith when trickery is an option. To the communists, our governments, our employers, our bishops, and our fathers were just a gang of hostage-takers who had managed to abduct entire nations.It may be true, as the paleoconservatives point out, that foreign wars are a threat to American traditions and a spur to big government, so the right should try to be against them.",
        "In the face of a revolutionary threat of this sort, though, these worries are academic. Communism was a threat to everything conservatives were committed to defending. And the threat was real. Half of the world had already fallen to these new Jacobins, and they had won the allegiance of our intellectual and entertainment classes. On the other hand, to a liberal, the communists were basically right in their criticism of us.",
        "The respectable liberal only objected to the brutal means the communists used–they were trying to go “too fast”. On the destination, there was little dissent. Therefore, both sides were partly wrong and partly right, so the hostility between them was tragic and unnecessary. Hence, it made sense that in the Cold War, it would be conservatives who would lean “hawkish.”Why, though, were people so quick to generalize and speak about propensities of the “right” and “left” in general.",
        "As a viewer of 1960’s science fiction, I think I can answer that too. Firstly, all the television and movie makers were rooting for the communists. Second, their audiences most certainly were not. Screenwriters knew that nobody would pay to see a movie about heroic reds defeating reactionaries and capitalist pigs to set up the dictatorship of the proletariat. Still, they wanted to advance the Cause somehow.",
        "So they struck up the idea of advancing “peace”: movie after movie and TV show after TV show would advance the idea that everyone could get along fine if we could just get rid of a few people (inevitably American military men) called “hawks” who want to provoke a nuclear war for no reason. By sapping the will of the West to resist while doing nothing against communist morale (after all, these movies weren’t made for them), these peace movies effectively advanced the communist side.",
        "As a side effect, they gave us our contemporary stereotypes about rightist hawks and leftist doves.Filed under: Conservatism vs Liberalism |Unfortunately such left-leaning ideological distortion still seems to be with us! The good news is that their media monopoly is *gone*.Hello Mr. Long,Thanks for stopping by. I’d like to take comfort in what you’re saying. It’s true that the news media can no longer spin stories with complete impunity.",
        "On the other hand, leftist hegemony in the academic and entertainment worlds (where opinions are really shaped) seems to me more complete than ever. Still, I guess those of us “on the wrong side of history” should welcome any good news that comes our way.Hello: this is several years later, but you seem to have been prescient. The “left” nowadays (not a monolithic term) in American politics seems to lean heavily towards war with various foreign powers, at least as heavily as the “right”.",
        "I wonder if at least some of this is due to the alleged “conservatism” of the new Russia. Sorry about all the scare-quotes, but political alliances are shifting so rapidly in America as to make all these terms somewhat doubtful (their usage varies depending on the speaker) ."

Her parents felt that it was in their daughter’s best interests to be educated outside her home state, as standards are lower than in other parts of the country.",

The six-month course was the first to exclusively target female entrepreneurs in Myanmar.“The incubation programme gave me the skills to refine my business idea.",
        "If I didn’t take part in it, I don’t think I would have started my business,” she said.Like many people in Myanmar, where bank loans are virtually unobtainable without collateral, Rosy lacked funding to back her bright idea.",
        "Fortunately, the knowledge she acquired through PHY’s programme helped her to develop creative solutions to counter financial constraints, which is an integral part of start-up business methodology.While still working at the hospital, Rosy began selling Chin fabrics for a handful of Chin women.",
        "She photographed the fabrics and uploaded them to her Facebook page, Rosy’s Chin Fabrics, so that she received orders instead of speculatively purchasing anything.“I also used my colleagues at the hospital, 99 percent of whom were female, to do market research.",
        "They were all interested in Chin fabrics and I got to know the price range they were willing to spend.”She also quickly discovered that Myanmar women are eager to wear fabrics belongings to a different ethnicity.“Bamar women have no problem wearing different fabrics.",
        "If the price is right, they actually prefer to wear tribal fabrics because it makes them stand out,” she explained.Once she had a sizeable number of orders, Rosy began travelling to Chin State to source the fabrics.However Rosy’s parents were dismayed to learn that their daughter planned to launch an online business rather than continuing her work as a medical officer.“My mother wanted me to have a stable, respected profession.",
        "It took me six months to convince her that I wouldn’t give up my medical career entirely and that I could balance it with my online business,” she said.By day, Rosy runs her online business and at night she works as a medical consultant for a parenting website.Rosy has been running her business for 18 months now and has her family’s full support.",
        "When she gave birth seven months ago, her mother volunteered to travel to Chin State to buy the fabrics.“My mother works with my second cousin, who belongs to a group of weavers.”However, although Rosy and her mother know a great deal about the traditions behind Chin weaving, which is considered the most intricate of any ethnicity in Myanmar and requires at least two weeks to complete a single piece, neither know how to weave.“My mother cannot weave and I also cannot, so it’s unlikely that my daughter will learn either,” said the 28-year-old.“The number of Chin people who know how to weave is decreasing.",
        "Women my age don’t know how to weave – those who do are my grandmother’s age, which makes it almost impossible to pass on the information.”If the tradition of hand-weaving were to die out altogether, it would be a huge loss to a fascinating tradition. Whilst Chin fabrics have more than an ornamental role, with shawls keeping its bearers warm in one of the coolest areas of tropical Myanmar, many are rich in cultural significance.",
        "Shawls are highly specific to each of the dozen sub-groups of the Chin people and are also used to mark significant occasions, such as marriage and death.",
        "Special blankets, historically woven by the bride, are presented to a couple to mark their marriage – and cover the corpse upon death.A red shawl, which incidentally looks very much like Scottish tartan, is given to a male who in earlier times fought and killed an enemy from another village, or killed an animal that threatened the safety of his fellow villagers.",
        "The shawl is worn during the celebrations that follow, and other men who previously received the honour also don red shawls.Women of certain Chin tribes receive a white, green and red shawl when they get married, and wear black and white shawls during periods of mourning. Orange is a popular colour for shawls worn by Chin people (who are also sometimes referred to as Zomi) in India, which borders Chin State.",
        "Rosy’s primary market is domestic but she also ships items to the United States, where a sizeable population of Chin people live.Rosy said that new fabric patterns are created every few months, but added that Chin weaving is becoming increasingly rare due to the lack of livelihood opportunities it offers in modern times.“My dream and vision is to inspire young women living in villages in Chin State to know that they can still make a living out of weaving,” she said.While machine-made alternatives exist, Rosy steers well clear of them: every item on offer is produced by a handloom.“This is a socially responsible business – products made using a machine simply won’t work for me.",
        "When everything is done by a machine, there’s no value in it. And machines cannot do the most complex work.”Rosy is also keen to motivate other women to start their own businesses and follow their passions.“I have always wanted to inspire other women to start something new and to follow their dreams. Even if there is a lot of pressure and a lack of support, just keep at it and eventually you will succeed – you will get somewhere if you put enough effort in.",
        "When I started my business I didn’t get enough sleep: I had to learn online skills and it took a lot of time. But finally it’s paid off,” she said.(Featured in Mizzima Weekly Issue 20 – To )"

        "We practice throughout the entire Commonwealth and have developed a core competency in helping our clients delay tax sales or canceling them outright.What We DoIn order to sell off a citizen's property, the government must meet a number of regulatory criteria. Landowners must be given due warning that their property will be put up for auction, and every facet of the notice must be accurate. Likewise, the information provided to the public about a given property must be correct in every aspect.",
        "Yet the government is prone to lapses in detail, and often misinforms both landowners and the public about the details of a sale.Our firm can leverage any government error to postpone a sale, and in some cases can nullify sales that have already taken place. Such oversights include:- Government failure to notify property owner of an impending tax sale- Deficiencies in the warning notice itself (i.e. incorrect dates and times of the sale)- Incorrect identification of the sale property (i.e.",

Maybe even the Sun-Times will write about it. Soon it will be crowded with suburban scenesters and no longer be our little secret. But it's a small part.

More realistic would be to do ikezukuri with vegetables. We could, for instance, specialize in garlic and grow our own on the premises.

        "This work, and slightly edited blog post, is from a new Project Basecamp researcher that prefers to remain behind the scenes. We welcome any researchers to join the Basecamp team.One of the most interesting “products” in Project Basecamp was CoDeSys, because this runtime library is used literally by hundreds of vendors. In fact, most users probably don’t even know that their PLC is running CoDeSys libraries. The CoDeSys password mechanism was found to only be effective if you used their GUI.",
        "Of course an attacker could easily access the PLC directly via the command line or ftp with no password required. The vendor (3S) claimed:In general, we do not offer any standard tools in CODESYS which are to protect the controller from a serious cyber attack.",
        "Should the offered password functionality suggest such a protection, this was definitely not our intention.This is proving to be true for the protection of 3S and their OEM customers’ intellectual property.When a vendor is using CoDeSys as his IEC61131-3 runtime, there is not a lot of room to distinguish your product from all the others using CoDeSys too. However, one way is vendor specific libraries.",
        "These are essentially CoDeSys programs with specific functions or function blocks, but with the file extension .lib. Those libraries can be imported into any normal user program.Say a user wants to have his PLC program get a configuration file from an FTP server.",
        "The vendor may provide a library with an FTP_Client function block that can be imported and just used instead of the user having to write all the tedious socket handling.Now as a vendor, these libraries are essentially intellectual property and should be protected as such. CoDeSys with it’s software history has loads of options to do this:Now “encrypted internal library” sounds like what we want.",
        "Unfortunately, to import an encrypted library, you have to provide the encryption key and thus essentially provide the decryption to customers.",
        "So the way to go (and most vendors, including 3S themsel ves, choose this path) is to use an internal library and protect it with a project password:When a password is entered there, the saved library will still be importable with the library manager, but when you try to open it directly with CoDeSys, a password prompt is shown:When the library is copied to another computer, the prompt still shows when trying to open it and the password is still checked correctly, so that means the password has to be inside the .lib file.Once you take a look at a file comparison of a password protected .lib and a clean one, it’s almost immediately clear, how the “encryption” works:Small side note here: this knowledge is apparently not new.",
        "When searching the web for things like “codesys library decrypt” you will find that users in Russian PLC forums already have the knowledge to “unPassword” codesys libraries.",
        "There even is some Chinese allround software that can find the passwords for libraries and generate keys for Beckhoff’s TwinCAT software.So just by looking at the password protected version of the library, I saw the algorithm to “decrypt” it, threw together a python script to do it and did an extensive internet search for publicly downloadable codesys libraries once the script worked.",
        "Downloaded all of them and let my python script run against all of them.I found 489 unique codesys libraries as public downloads on the Internet. 323 (66%) of those libraries were not protected at all. So either the content was not supposed to be protected from view by the customer or the vendor did not know how to do it.",
        "This left 166 (34%) of all libraries I found to be protected by a password, so those vendors did care about their intellectual property.Of the 166 passwords I found:The passwords themselves are not that creative with “HELLO” being the bottom of the pit. I can just imagine the snickering developers, when entering their library password “rc3sexpert”.",
        "But the funniest one was when the library literally talked to me, with “youthief” as its password.Well, once again vendors trusted 3S in providing them with a safe and sound product and were betrayed.",
        "Now all that precious intellectual property hiding inside the “protected” libraries is basically public knowledge.This time around, they will also not be able to claim that the password was never intended as a protection mechanism as they did last time.This excuse will not work since they used the mechanism for their own IP in the CANopen Stack libraries, “protected” by the password “STACK3S”.Well, this was all done using the old version of CoDeSys (V2.3.x), not the V3.",
        "But I’m not sure the library protection is any better with the new version. So go ask 3S for better protection of your intellectual proptery in upcoming versions. Also, it is always wise to really check the integrity of a third-party mechanism that you will trust your IP with…And finally, there are quite some vendors I could not obtain all/any libraries from. e.g. Beckhoff has an army of libraries as extension for TwinCAT from “Building Automation” to “Communication” to “Motion”.",
        "All of those are downloadable but require a license key (and I did not intend to use the chinese software to get one). You can still try one of the following passwords or just find out how the encraption works by yourself.Password List:Image by Mike RohdeWell this makes an upcoming German ICS security event so much more interesting. On July 4, 3S founder and CEO Dieter Hess will be giving a talk at the VDI Industrial Security Conference titled “Crime scene: Industrial Controller!",
        "Security support in the Codesys engineering software”. The stage will (?) be set aptly for Hess by a preceding talk from Fabian Koch from ABB titled “After Project Basecamp. What’s the elevation of the summit?”. Let’s just hope that Hess’ talk will either be very brief or very elaborate. Being not overly optimistic, I think I should suggest to my esteemed German colleges to save the $1900 for the VDI event and buy a ticket for S4 instead.Link:."

        "Communications between the villages were relayed from Ventura and Santa Barbara to Boney Ridge to Point Dume and on to Surfrider, home to the southern most Chumash Village in California Humaliwo.How Point Dume Received It’s NameWesterners first discovered Point Dume in 1542 when Spanish explorer Cabrillo passed the Point on his way up the California coast.",
        "It wasn’t until 1793 when explorer George Vancouver traveling south named the promontory Point Dumetz in honor of his friend Father Francisco Dumetz. Over the years the tz was dropped and the landmark became known as Point Dume.",
        "To this day many people debate the pronunciation, with some calling it Point Dume (Do-may) and others preferring Point Dume (Doom).The Army’s Use of the LandAs late as the early 1900’s the Point was a barren windswept headland with nothing but an oil well located near present day intersection of Dume Drive and Sea Lion Place. During World War II, Point Dume was an important lookout station for the US Army and Coast Guard. It was also used as a target range for the Army.",
        "Targets were mounted on railroad cars that would move on a track by gravity along what is present day Cliffside drive and then winched back up to the headlands to repeat the cycle. The army fired 50 caliber machine guns and anti aircraft weapons at the targets which fell harmlessly into the ocean.",
        "The rail targets were later replaced by targets towed by planes which would fly over the point.The Development of Point Dume Luxury HomesShortly after the war ended the Point was opened up for development and it was subdivided into residential lots. Bluff top lots along Cliffside Drive were selling for $2400 a piece but it was thought that you could never build on Point Dume due the high winds. Slowly over time the lots were bought up and single story ranch homes begun to spring up.",
        "The Point was divided into Rivieras 1-5 each with its own designated beach easements and beach lots. Properties located in Riviera 4 & 5, the windward side of Point Dume, lost their beach lot in the 1970’s to eminent domain. Prior to that there were beachfront homes on Westward Beach Rd and Riviera 4 & 5 had ownership of a 200 foot lot on Westward Beach. Local government provided eucalyptus and pine trees as wind breaks.",
        "Ironically, those same trees today block the very views many early residents enjoyed. Unlike the movie stars, musicians, and producers that now call the Point home, its first residents were working class people like teachers, engineers, firemen, and civil servants. In the 1940s, the top of the headlands was shaved off for the purpose of building a luxury hotel it was determined to not be a feasible location due to geological concerns.",
        "One early general plan had a hotel, golf course, polo field, horse paddocks, lighthouse and a mix of light residential lots. Modern day Point Dume consist of over 600 homes, condos, and apartments. Point Dume today is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Malibu and those same $2400 lots once thought unbuildable sell for $10,000,000 if you can find one. Point Dume is California Registered Historical Landmark No. 965 a plaque commemorating the designation is located at the top of headlands."

        "Tuesday, January 1, 2013Review: Raised From the Ground3.5 Stars - Recommended to fans of historic epic family stories / Not recommended as an intro to the authorPgs: 363Publisher: Houghton Mifflin HarcourtReleased: Dec'12The more I read Jose Saramago's earlier works, the more I appreciate his distinctive writing style.",
        "Originally written in his native language in 1980, Saramago's posthumously translated Raised From the Ground gives us a glimpse of the conversational, long-flowing sentences and creative characterization that become commonplace in his later fiction.In this, the author's most personal novel, Saramago tells the story of three generations of Mau Tempo's - a hard working, illiterate, and landless family - in a fascinating and wholly engaging way.",
        "Forget reading a book about the things that happen to this growing family of peasants who work their knuckles to the bone out in the fields of Alentejo in order to keep food on their plates and a roof over their head.",
        "Instead, find yourself pulled through the pages by the narrator as he sits besides you and decadently deviates from the tale of these unfortunate grandparents and daughters and sons from time to time, zooming in among the pebbles on the path that our Mau Tempo's walk to show us the thin line of ants who parade alongside these humans on their very own survival mission, and drawing our focus towards the dribble of water that spills from a bucket, contemplating the liquid's fate as members of the Mau Tempo family fight to see another day.A story of perseverance in the face of public humiliation and political punishment, Saramago's strong feelings for church and government dance in the background as he dazzles us with the simple strength of human will.",
        "In a time when standing up for your rights found you jailed and tortured, we are urged to watch as generation after generation of the Mau Tempo men attempt to make a better living for their families.Saramago and his crafty narrator find the perfect balance between satire and sadness, where elements of history and humor mix together expertly to keep the tears from forming in your eyes as you root for the hardy farm workers to finally get their day in the sun.I found the novel to be somewhat long in the tooth - the ponderous deviations that I look forward to in Saramago's later novels are still figuring themselves out here, sometimes appearing at the wrong moment, other times deviating so far off the story's path that it actually slows the tale's momentum rather than enhance it.",
        "Yet as I say that, Saramago also manages moments of sheer perfection as his mind strays from the story - most often in the form of an additional perspective during events that are taking place. Our narrator has no qualms stepping back and allowing another to tell the goings-on when the opportunity arises. Take for instance this thin line of ants that happen to find themselves in the path of one of the Mau Tempo men as they fall to the ground from a beating.",
        "Our narrator allows the lead ant, which holds its head like a dog, to share what it is seeing in that very moment, how it observes and makes note of the man's bruised and battered face, a face it shall never forget, before the ant moves on to wherever he and his friends were headed.",
        "And later in the story, we are treated again to their perspective, when this same line of ants find themselves moving along the walls of the prison that the battered man is being held and tortured in...A moving tale that demonstrates the cunning and creative beginnings of a wickedly talented Nobel-laureate novelist.Great review. Intrigued, particularly about the ant becoming the narrator."

        "The Rest Of My Life Is For You Chapter 171Translator:Atlas StudiosEditor:Atlas StudiosAs Shangxin finished her sentence, a loud gasp sounded instantly in the public relations department.Everyone present was stupefied!Shangxin, who usually would not accept any endorsements, had really accepted the deal from their company.Ye Mingmin stared blankly and did not come back to her senses for a few seconds. However, Shangxin did not seem to mind and shook Nian Xiaomu’s hands tightly. “We will meet again soon.",
        "You guys don’t have to send me off.”“There might be reporters at the main gate. I will ask the secretary to send all of you out through the back door,” Nian Xiaomu replied hurriedly.“Okay.” Shangxin nodded her head.",
        "However, she appeared to still have something to say when her manager, who was beside her, whispered something in her ears.The expression on her face flickered slightly; she looked Nian Xiaomu in the eye deeply before she left with her manager.The moment they entered the elevator.Her manager couldn’t resist it and said, “You know that your family will be unhappy if you accept endorsements.",
        "Why did you still agree to Nian Xiaomu’s request?”“Because she gave me the courage to persevere on!” Shangxin’s eyes were filled with obscurity. A long time later, she spoke again, “Actually, she resembled a friend that I knew a long time ago.",
        "Except for the fact that that person…”Shangxin seemed to have recalled an unhappy memory; her eyes dropped as she fell silent.The delegation left quietly in the same manner that they had when they first arrived.The public relations department was rejoicing because of the successful endorsement deal that had been clinched with Shangxin!“Great!",
        "Our collaboration with Sheng Da Science and Technology will be better and better from now on with the endorsement that we clinched with Shangxin!”“I would become so emotional whenever the thought of Shangxin accepting our endorsement deal appeared in my mindshe was someone who would never accept any endorsements! Quick, pinch me.",
        "I want to check if I am dreaming…”“I will bring this piece of good news to Manager Wen now!” The secretary turned around and headed right to the manager’s office the moment she came back to her senses.All of them were still celebrating in the office area.Fang Lan was the only one who was squeezed right into the corner.",
        "As she looked at her colleagues who were exchanging joyously with one another, the words of threat that she had used on Nian Xiaomu rang incessantly in her ears.“If she really did manage to invite Shangxin, I would willingly kneel and kowtow to her three times publicly, let alone apologize publicly!”She had bet on the fact that Shangxin would not accept the endorsement.",
        "Hence, she preyed on the chance that Nian Xiaomu would make a fool out of herself and wanted to subsequently chase Niao Xiaomu out of the public relations department.However, Fang Lan had never expected that not only had Shangxin kept her promise and appeared for the meeting, she even readily accepted the endorsement.Anyone with eyes could see the hidden details behind the scene just now.Nian Xiaomu was the sole reason why Shangxin had agreed to the collaboration.Nian Xiaomu had now become the greatest hero of the public relations departmentshe wouldn’t actually expect Fang Lan to kowtow to her in apology, right?Fang Lan’s face turned ghastly pale in an instant.She shifted toward the door quietly and away from the attention of the others.After she left the office, she would next use the reason of her body being unwell as an excuse and avoid heading to work for the next few days.",
        "As time passed, everyone would naturally forget about this incident.Yes! This was the way to go!As Fang Lan thought of this, her footsteps hastened; the door seemed to be just steps away from her as she weaved through the crowd.“Fang Lan, you seem to be in a hurry. Where are you heading to?” someone spoke loudly out of the blue.Just a moment ago, the public relations department still had a bustling atmosphere.",
        "Suddenly, the entire department quieted down.Everyone turned around and stared in Fang Lan’s direction without exception.Fang Lan, who was about to sneak away secretly, instantly froze right at the door!“I recall that someone had mentioned that if Supervisor Nian managed to enlist Shangxin for the endorsement deal, she would kowtow three times before her in apology. Isn’t it time for this someone to fulfill her promise"

        "A few years ago, I spent quite a bit of time learning about andunderstanding the coaxial collinear construction, and hope that what Ilearned can benefit others:1. Each section must provide 180 degrees phase shift. That is, each mustbe 1/2 wave long, taking into account the propagation velicity of thecoax. With lossless line, then the _voltage_ between the ends ofthe radiating (outer conductor) part of adjacent elements will bein phase and equal amplitude all along the antenna.",
        "What you _really_want is in-phase antenna current in each element, which in-phasevoltage does not guarantee, but the simulations I've done indicate thatthe currents are all very nearly in phase, given the equal inphasevoltages. The current magnitudes are low in some elements of longarrays, but that just means that those elements don't contribute much tothe overall pattern; the important thing is that their currents arestill in phase, so they don't detract from the pattern.",
        "Practicalcoax has low enough loss to do a very good job making the voltagesequal.(This supports the measure carefully/construct carefully advice.)2. You are essentially end-feeding a bunch of elements. The phasingsystem puts the feedpoints electrically in parallel. (Remember: theload impedance you put on the end of a half-wave piece of coax isechoed back to the feedpoint.",
        "In this antenna, start at the top withone impedance, echo that back 1/2 wave and parallel it with anotherimpedance...) When you have few sections, the net parallel effectis still a fairly high impedance. (You can't just say you'reparalleling equal resistances, because there is mutual coupling amongall the elements, but in a qualitative sense, it's what's happening.)So the feedpoint impedance at the bottom of the antenna will beprobably in the 400 ohm region with just 3 or 4 elements.",
        "With 10elements, it drops to the 150 ohm region. Whatever it is, you mustmatch that to your feedline if you want low SWR. For one-off antennas,I like to use an \"L\" matching network, with a coil in series, and atrimmer cap shunt across the antenna. (Note: you can feed thisantenna at the end, or across the connection between any pair ofelements.",
        "Remember, 1/2 wave sections just echo the impedance.)Also note: the elements are considerably less than 1/2 wave long.The half-wave is taking the coax velocity factor into account, butas radiators, they are only about 0.66*1/2 wave (if you use solidpoly coax) or 0.8*1/2 wave (if you use foam dielectric cable). Sothey are NOT RESONANT. That is NOT a problem. Non-resonant antennasradiate just fine; it's just that their feedpoint impedance is NOTa pure resistance.",
        "So...the matching network must also take out somereactance. Again, an \"L\" matching network does this just fine. Do NOTexpect a simple 1/4 wave of 75 ohm line (like shown in the ARRLwriteup) to do a good job in all cases.3. As with any antenna, you must be sure the feedline is decoupled fromthe antenna to assure the antenna pattern remains as you designed it.You can do this with radials, sleeves, chokes, ... but especiallywith a high gain antenna, it's an important part of the design.",
        "I'mfinding that chokes (coils of feedline) at the base of the antenna andanother a quarter wave or so lower work well. But other ways work too.Summary: Get the phasing right by making the sections an electricalhalfwave...use careful construction. But errors of 1% or so won't killyou. Match the resulting impedance to your feedline: don't worry thatthe antenna is not \"resonant\".",
        "Decouple the antenna from the feedline.If you divide the problem into these three separate items and get eachright, it will work for you.(Note: if you do it this way, you can see that putting it into a\"radome\" of fiberglass or PVC pipe, so long as the pipe isn't too lossy,will change the impedance (requiring a change in the matching networktuning), because it changes the mutual coupling among elements, but itdoesn't materially change the phasing, because that's all done in thecoax electrical length.",
        "And the antenna gain is critically dependent onthe phasing, not on the particular feedpoint impedance.)(Another paper I wrote a couple years ago about coaxial collinears will be added soon. With luck I'll even figure out how to add some pictures!)"

        "Here is my registration story! As, I told you all earlier, I started a new job today. That caused me to worry about my Ironman registration. My plan was to take my lap top and be online at 11:55 to get in right away. I get work, hook up my laptop, find the local wireless . . . I'm all set.The head attorney (my boss) was out of the office most of the morning but discussed me attending an 11:00 meeting. I immediately got nervous about the timing.",
        "I wasn't sure where the meeting was going to but thought I could make it work. My co-worker then came in and started discussing an 11:00 meeting. That meeting was two doors down in a conference room. This must be the meeting the boss was talkig about. PERFECT! She said it wouldn't last long and if it ran over I could excuse myself to go register.",
        "PERFECT!At 10:59 I started to walk out of my office for the meeting when the secretary comes in and gives me the directions to a DIFFERENT 11:00 meeting at the tribal casino. UGH! The tribal casino is 10 minutes away. I book it to my meeting hoping it will be short and that I can get back in time. Last year I thought registration stayed open for an hour. My year it was 20 minutes. I knew my window was small no matter what.I attend the meeting and it was awesome. I think I'm going to enjoy my new job.",
        "BUT the meeting went past Noon. By the time I travel back to my office, it is 12:37. I try to register and it is sold out. I about cried. Without talking to my husband, GULP, I went ahead and signed up for a Foundation slot. [For the non-Ironman folks reading this, Ironman registration is pricy. Regular registration is $650. A Foundation slot is $1300! Half of the Foundation entry fee goes to charity. Can you believe that?! ]I had to do it though. I couldn't get shut out of this race.",
        "I am so excited to train with all these other ladies. It will be such a better experience than the last time. I can't wait!So that is my story. I am registered for Ironman Arizona 2012. I better spend a lot of time training b/c I won't be able to afford to do much else!PS - I told my husband and he was fine. He said \"Merry Christmas!\" He is the BEST!Does it make you feel any better to know half is tax deductible--no--well I'm trying! So glad you're in, I've been checking FB all day to check up on you.",
        "Congrats on the new job too.Yay Ron for being such a great supporter! We are really doing it!Y'know I would've cried if you didn't make it in. THANKS RON!!!So glad you got in even with the big hit in the wallet!I started a blog too so I can remember this year :)I signed up for IMAZ yesterday too! I feel kinda lucky considering it sold out online in 10 mins. Hope you girls have a great year of training and enjoying the journey.Believe me, I used the tax deductible line when I was telling him what I did!",
        "So glad he was a good sport! Excited to go to your blog Johanne! Donna - Welcome! I'm glad you found us so we can go on this crazy adventure together!"

        "Today was an amazing journey. We rose at 4:30am after a sheltered night and walked 5km down the mountain and across the desert floor using head lamps for light. Walking at dawn is beautiful and freezing, we heard owls hooting and the smell of wet grass is over powering.",
        "We stop for a short time under a bridge called Scissors Crossing where water has been left for hikers to use along with some oranges and Keith from the army veterans group makes us a strong cup of coffee – and we think about taking a swig of taquila left for hikers passing by.We are all apprehensive about our next clime, 22kms and no water. As the sun rose into the valley we rose off the desert floor and through some truely amazing flora.",
        "The cacti in this particular area completely transported me and lifted my spirits. All in bloom the tall spinderly plants seem to sway and defy gravity resembling coral and giving it an under-water like feeling.I (Harriet) have recently been given the trail name Pine Cone (because of picking up giant pinecones near Mt Laguna with my long nail extensions) this kept me feeling positive and entertained whilst also having some rather amusing pseudo-hippie thoughts like;Who are we animals?",
        "We are not bound to earth like plants, unlike soil we are animate, unlike water we are contained . . .I’m sure this will seem pretty lame in about 2 seconds.We push on until 1:30 when we feeling well and truely footsore and the sun is burning us off the path. We stop in some chaparelle and essemble the tent fly for some shade.",
        "We eat lunch and rejoice in the fact that we have already walked 29km and most of it uphill!We rest and read and lie around until we set off again and reach the second water dispatch. We are limited to 3 litres each which seems so little in the heat of the afternoon. After chatting to fellow hikers about the abundance of snow in the High Sierra we push on to the very top of the range and set up camp for the night! I’m so proud for our resilience and endurance today!",
        "Our bodies are amazing!What a fabulous effort…we are proud and impressed with your resilience and endurance as well! Wonderful young women!!!! Love youse all. GaylIf you ladies are already strong enough to be doing this kind of mileage, and are wiling to get up @ 4:30am to accommodate the trail, then you should be fine in the Sierra.When there’s snow, if really doesn’t matter if it’s 10″ or 10′ deep, either way you’re walking over snow.",
        "The key is to adapt to the trail as it dictates the situation (just like you’re doing in the desert right now). For the Sierra, that means getting over the passes between 7-9am. If that means getting up @ 4am and hiking in freezing pre-dawn for 3 hours before reaching a pass, then that’s what needs to be done.Hiking during the spring in the Sierra is one of life’s great experiences. Those who do it never forget. I go every year about the time PCTers are heading north from KM.",
        "Whatever you do, don’t let anyone try and talk you out of doing it if the conditions and weather are ok ie 6/15 ->Here’s a trip report from last year to give you a sense of what it’s like:Hey Hobbes, thanks for your words of encouragement. We are definitely leaning towards waiting for the snows to melt a bit before going into the Sierras."

        "I used to work with Fish and Wildlife and saw these little guys quite a bit in streams. In fact, they’re found in most streams around the world. However, very few people have ever seen them like this!Incredibly creative, French artist Hubert Duprat has used the Caddis fly larvae to make jewelry. Wait, don’t get grossed out yet, there’s gold and semi-precious jewels involved! Hold that nausea.",
        "Take a look at their little “sleeping bag” homes they create when supplied with gold flakes and semi-precious jewels instead of their usual building materials of sand and wood detritus found in stream beds.Duprat teaches us a beautiful lesson about Adaptability. (Beautiful if you don’t look too close at the Caddis, that is.)Life puts you in a particular stream. Work with what you’re given!I believe each of us is put into a different stream with different building materials.",
        "Regardless of the material that’s there, our talents can be expressed and needs will be met. Duprat says that he “creates the conditions necessary for the caddis to display their talents.” That is life, my friends. Co-create With Life.The larvae may WANT what is in another Caddis larvae’s stream- like parts of twigs, plants or sand, but it creates with what it has.You know what they say about “one man’s junk is another one’s treasure”- right?",
        "Either way, all of us are given our own building materials to combine with our own abilities.",
        "What each of us builds will look different, unique and satisfy OUR individual needs.The Caddis larvae that spends its time wishing it had different building materials doesn’t build, and becomes fish food rather quickly!No matter if you’ve been supplied with pebbles and twigs, or turquoise and gold – you have unique talents to create your own masterpiece, your home and your life.Definitely take two minutes (literally) out of your day to check out his incredibly clever idea and artwork!",
        "Caddis Fly used in Jewellery: .Very cool Mikey thanksis this the “amazing world record sweet potato master farmer hater of stink bugs” Ted? nice to see you in the blogosphere… have a great day! 🙂 mikeyI love your wit and your positive attitudes.

Well until next time, I guess.Excellent comment, I love it!",
        "I would only guess that Gold is as Useless to a caddis fly larvae as Manure is to something Not a dung beetle – YET it still uses its talent and nature to create. I love the science in you that sees those relationships, so cool. thanks for stopping by…. 🙂 mikeyAs a jewellery maker, I can do nothing but love this with all my heart! I had seen this jewellery before, but forgotten about it, and I had never seen that video.",
        "The way you frame this and draw the parallells with how we deal with our own life situation adds a deeper perspective. What a great reminder to “work with what you’re given”! A sort of survival instinct, to create what we have to create, no matter what.thanks so much!! I gotta’ ask you, the pro, any ideas if the jewelry would sell?? I just think that once the ladies know how it was made, they wouldn’t want it..? The guy is ingenious for trying the idea.",

        "When looking for the best possible option to store your snowmobile, you need to make many considerations. The space available (outside and the inside), the number of sleds you have, the value of the sleds you have, where you ride regularly, the safety and other local regulations, your budget and other personal preferences.Now you store the sled outside if you have space restrictions inside. This is also the cheapest possible storage space you could ask for. What you need is a good quality cover, or a tarp.",
        "You may need a pallet if you have more than one sled. In such cases, you may rack up the sleds in the pallet. However, there are many drawbacks of storing your sled outside. In most cases, there is high chance that you may need to dig the snowmobile out of the snow. This can lead to a lot of wear and tear to the sled and a lot of money being spent in the repair. Also, storing the sled outside is not so safe. A snowmobile parked in the snow may require prolonged warm up sessions.",
        "And the other main drawback is security issues. A snowmobile parked outside can easily be stolen and so it is good if you have full insurance coverage of your sled.Another way to store the sled is to build a shelter for it. Now for this you can try the market available built in options or you can try making a custom based one yourself.",
        "Shelter provides better protection to your sled and may reduce snow damage to some point.If you have to regularly move your sled to the trails by using a trailer, then it is better to house the sled in the trailer itself. They offer all round protection to the sled throughout the season. You can place other related accessories also. Imagine having two or more sleds and loading and unloading it every day. It is not an easy task.",
        "So if you have a trailer, you can keep your sleds inside the trailer itself ad you are good to go. It is better to have an enclosed trailer than the open one. An enclosed trailer provides good protection from the outside elements. You can still use an open trailer, but use a tarp to protect the sleds from snow, rain, etc.In the above three cases, you may need to get the sled into the warehouse for be it repairing or for summer storage, you may need packaging solution.",
        "Clip Lok offers stackable package options in this scenario. They offer transport box for the snowmobiles which is stackable. The base of the box has clamps to strap the snowmobile so they remain fixed during the transportation. There is also a ramp for easy loading and unloading. So you can carry more sleds at a time to the warehouse. This method has proven to reduce the damage cost to the snowmobiles and also warehouse cost due to the stackable feature.",
        "You can check out the website to know more about this stackable snowmobile transportation system.Now, that would be the case if you are housing the sled outside or away from your garage. The best possible way is to store the sled in your garage. So they are in close proximity and be less worried about the security of your sled. They are also protected from the outside elements. You can also repair them as and when needed. Also, the additional cost of transportation to the warehouse can be cut out.",
        "But, the problem here is that the sleds can take up more garage space and it may be difficult to move around them. The studs in the snowmobile can eve damage the garage floor.There are many methods to address these issues. You can use snowmobile dollies to move around the sleds. But they may still leave the sled on the garage floor. Also, when having multiple sleds, the storage space issue is still not addressed.",
        "In such cases, the best method to store your sleds is the snowmobile rack system.The snowmobile rack system offers vertical storage. So you can be sure that the space constraints are solved. You can maximize the storage options with minimizing the garage floor it utilizes. What more can you ask for? If you can simply lift one sled and make room for the other. The conventional ones have been made from wood with had winches.",
        "The latest models involve those built in steel and having electric winches which provides the additional easy of working with these storage systems. You can build one by using the storage system plans available in Pinterest and YouTube. They provide detailed explanation of how you can build one. Other option is buying the storage system from the companies building them. Some may provide you customizable options too.",
        "Some of the companies providing storage options are listed below.Super Lift offers customizable options if you want to build one of your own. Their SNOWMOBILE 1000 Model has 1000lb lower and upper capacities with storage available for two snowmobiles. They have hand winch or electric winch option. They have easy loading ramp.Brock Lift offers lift garage storage platforms for ATV, UTVs, Motorcycles, Dirt bikes and Snowmobiles. The Brock Lift 1100 has 1100lb capacity and 4ftX8ft platform.",
        "The motor has a power of 1.5HP. They have an all steel frame.The other model is the Brock Lift2000 offering heavy duty 6ftX9ft platform and lifting up to 2000lbs with the 2HP motor.",
        "They can lift up to two ATVs or snowmobiles.Freestyle Projects offers storage systems with aluminum body and 12V electric winch.Garage Evolution offers storage system with lifting capacity of 1500lbs, constructed from industrial grade steel.With these options, you can indeed save a lot of space and keep the sled protected throughout the year. The right choice of the storage depends on your individual preferences."

        "Hey beauties,For the last year, I have been going to Danish classes about 4 times a week. Most of the time I resented it and couldn’t be happier for the day I’d be done with language school.",
        "But now I’m almost done and I feel like I’m not ready to be “released” into Danish society just yet.In Denmark there are 3 language levels (for those that only went to elementary school, high school, or have an academic background) and I’m placed in the group with an academic background where the full education will lead up to level B2.",
        "So for most of last year, I have been in different classes with like-minded people and a lot of them I call my friends.While I was allowed to skip the first module pretty much on the basis of speaking Dutch, it still took me a year to finish module 2 til 5 (which I considering long, but it’s actually a lot shorter than the 3 years the government reserves for us). I never allowed myself to take any breaks, not even during summer.",
        "My dad learned Dutch in about 2/3 years and my mom, well lets just say that she “knows” Dutch and they did this all under the pressure of a 60 hour a week job.",
        "So I was (and still am) determined to get a hold on this language.Most of the time though, I didn’t really felt that my Danish was improving at all and in my mind I always made the next module the benchmark of being fluent: while being in module 3, I’d say “when I’m in module 4, I’ll be fluent” and while being in module 4, I’d say the same about module 5.",
        "I’d always feel intimidated by those darn Germans, because somehow they were always fluent as soon as they just walked into the class room. And over the year, I’ve received a lot of feedback (or critique) from my teachers on my writing assignment.",
        "But honestly, who wants to write a 200 words essay about the Danish healthcare system?So now I’ve finished the first half of the final exam (level B2) and I just received the below messaged from the language school:First of all, I have to start with the Danish grading scale, it might be the weirdest system world-wide. The lowest grade is a -3, passing is 02 and 12 is the highest grade.",
        "While I was kinda aiming for “passing”, so it all would be done, I surprised myself with a 12 (A or 10/10) for reading and a 10 for writing (B or 9/10). While I received these fantastic grades, I still feel my Danish isn’t wat it is supposed to be. Of course, at this point I’m able to go see a doctor in Danish, order a beer at the bar or even do some small talking.",
        "But I definitely feel that I’m not completely able yet to let my personality shine through in Danish and I easily get caught of guard when people speak Danish to me. In 2 weeks I will have my (final) oral exam and if I pass this I will finally done: but do I really want to be done?I’m really hard for myself and while most people are satisfied with the regular “Danskuddannelse”, I’m still not content with my Danish these days.",
        "If I manage to graduate with a 10 on average, it’s possible to apply for “Studieprøve”: a Danish education, which leads to level C1. With this diploma you’re allowed to study at a Danish taught education (not that I’m interested in that), but it gives me some more time to develop my Danish skill further.",
        "So even though, I have shouted for the last year that I wanted Danish to be over I have to withdraw my words.Have you ever tried to learn a new language and has it been as frustrating as Danish has been for me?With love,-JanetFollow me on Bloglovin’ and on Facebookhet klinkt heel lastig, goed dat je toch gewoon doorgaat! de aanhouder wint zullen we maar zeggen :)!Dankje babe! En het einde is gelukkig in zicht 😀hi!",
        "i’m just a randomer passing by, but you really sound like you’re very hard on yourself. i’m studying to be a sign language interpreter, and while i’m in my fourth year of uni i still don’t feel entirely comfortable and fluent in sign language (which was an entirely new language to me). i have to practise every day or i lose it, and i have to repeat lots.",
        "learning a new language isn’t easy (as you clearly know), and i think you can give yourself some credit for doing well, and be a little kinder to yourself. i’d say, don’t compare yourself to anyone else and take it at your own pace, seems like you’re working hard enough. i’m sure you’ll get there and good luck!Hi Sabienne,Thank you for your sweet and encouraging comment! I know I should be more chilled about this new language and trust that, with time, it all will come.",
        "But it’s hard (as you might know) to stay positive, when you’re frustrated when things don’t run smoothly. I think it’s amazing that you’re studying sigh language and can’t even imagine how hard that must be. Good luck with your journey!PS: I loved your comment about not comparing myself with others, sometimes I forget that at the end of the day we all are different. Some do learn a new language within a sneeze and me, well apparently I need some time..",

        "The look of this dish, black and white, gives no clues concerning its flavour. The subtle aniseed and nutty notes of the soup, and unexpected sweetness of the black garlic crumbs, are sure to elicit some interesting responses from your fellow diners.The cannellini beans are the foundation, in terms of texture and taste, for the sweet aniseed of the roasted fennel and the nutty roasted cauliflower.",
        "It is a subtle yet hearty soup, equally at home on a cold winters night, or at a summer lunch.While the soup is delicious on its own, the black garlic crumble makes it unforgettable. A perfect counterpoint visually, as well as in terms of taste and texture. If you don’t like garlic, don’t let that put you off using black garlic.",
        "Changing raw garlic into black garlic is a truly transformational process – black garlic tastes quite different to the raw garlic it used to be, yet is as good for you as it ever was.Beans are widely available in cans. While very convenient, they are different from cooked fresh or dried beans. Have you ever compared the taste of canned peas to frozen or fresh peas? Almost a different vegetable.",
        "Serious Eats has a great post on all aspects of beans – soaking times, fresh versus canned, and the characteristics of different types of beans.One of the advantages of using dried beans is the opportunity to use aromatics (onion, garlic, and herbs) when cooking them. This will transform the beans into something much more flavorful, especially compared to what you get from a can.Roasted fennel cauliflower and cannellini bean soup.",

        "Nature Notes by Dr. Frank LangNature Notes is a long time member of the Crater Lake Natural History Association Board of Directors. The non-profit Association provides funding to the park and Oregon Caves for interpretive programs through our sale of books and other items. A board benefit is an occasional outing provided by the park. In August, the board was privileged to spend the night on Crater Lake’s Wizard Island courtesy of the Park Service.",
        "While there, three big fat toads along the trail surprised Nature Notes as he stumbled down from Wizard Island’s crater in the deepening twilight.Although it might be his imagination, Nature Notes thinks the western toad, Bufo boreas, was once more common. He remembers finding toads the size of dinner plates in andamong the sword ferns and goat’s beard in the garden of his childhood home. Well, maybe saucers.",
        "Great warty beasts that Papa always encouraged because of the damage they inflicted on his garden archenemy, the common slug. Those toads, however, did nothing to help in his constant battle with his other garden enemy, the neighbor’s cat.Now the cane or marine toad is another story.",
        "This six inch long toad, native to the Rio Grand south, was introduced to Florida after several tries where they have become, well, pests, famous for their gustatorial habitat of cleaning up Fido’s and Kitty’s uneaten pet food. Cane toads are voracious omnivores. Although they aren’t big enough to eat a cat, they have the where-with-all to kill one. Like many amphibians, their skins are toxic, toxic enough to kill a curious dog or cat.",
        "The toxin is produced by their parotid glands, the large warts back of both eyes. After handling a cane toad, be sure to wash your hands. Fortunately for the State of Jefferson, cane toads are sensitive to cold, which makes their presence on Wizard Island unlikely, the specter of global warming not withstanding.But back to Bufo boreas. Toads on Wizard Island were unexpected. How did they get there? What do they eat? Insects and other Arthropods? Slugs? Many questions.",
        "They probably over winter by crawling down in the spaces between the large clunky chunks of lava rock that makes going anywhere on Wizard Island, except on trails, difficult.Nature Notes knows from childhood experience that handling toads can be a hazard, for the handler and the toad. Handler gets peed upon when an overexcited toad looses a precious supply of fluid laced with toxins manufactured by glands in their bladder similar to those in its paratoid glands.",
        "In a relatively dry environment, toad has a rehydration problem. The handler just gets wet, unless he licks his fingers.Contrary to popular belief, handling toads will not give you warts, peed upon or not. Warts are cause by viruses not present in toads. While Googling around for this piece, Nature Notes was surprised to learn that a duct tape bandage on a wart causes it to disappear. Better than silk threads and stump water, he bets.",
        "And finally, Nature Notes wonders what might happen if a truly desperate princess kissed a Wizard Island toad.— Dr. Frank Lang"

        "/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/31843061/485547271.0.jpg)The Dallas Stars proved a worthy adversary once again on Friday night but ultimately found unforced errors to be their undoing in a rather demoralizing 3-2 loss to the Anaheim Ducks.The Stars opened the scoring on the power play after Jamie Benn drew a spearing penalty from Corey Perry, with Alex Chiasson finishing off a beautiful tick-tack-toe triangle passing play down low.",
        "The Stars would continue to control play through most of the first period and really put the pressure on Anaheim with an aggressive forecheck and some truly outstanding defensive backchecking by the forewards, but it wasn't enough to keep the Ducks off the scoreboard.Eric Cole, fighting through some chewed up ice along the boards, tried to move the puck into the middle and it picked off by Ryan Getzlaf who roofed a shot in tight to tie the game just a few minutes before the end of the period.The second on paper went well for the Stars up until the final few minutes of the frame, once again.",
        "The Ducks were able to slowly seize the momentum and tilt the ice in their favor, yet Dallas was able to get into lanes and block shots and survived lengthy cycles by Anaheim without surrendering too many prime chances. Yet again, however, it was a turnover that doomed the Stars.A hot pass from Tyler Seguin to Jamie Benn was quickly burped up to Corey Perry, who drew back and ripped a powerful shot in stride past Kari Lehtonen to give the Ducks the lead and all the momentum in the game.",
        "The Stars had slowly been pulled off their game by the relentless forecheck and aggression by the Ducks and the strategy has certainly worked so far -- the Ducks have feasted on Dallas turnovers and both goals were the product of turnovers with a Duck right in the face of the Stars.The same problems from the first game continued to plague the Stars in the third; Dallas came out charging hard to open the final frame, but couldn't cash in on several very prime opportunities before drawing a delay of game penalty to once again test their troubled power play.Instead, the Ducks took advantage of a blown slashing call to score shorthanded on a fire drill in front of Kari Lehtonen.",
        "It was the third goal in which Lehtonen went down low and the shot went high, and suddenly the Stars were facing another two-goal deficit in the third period and all of the momentum on the side of the Ducks.Ryan Garbutt made the game interesting by atoning for a bad first period penalty and scoring off a rebound midway through the third period, kicking off a long stretch of near-dominant play by the Stars that saw a lot of pressure but not a heck of a lot of actual rubber on net.",
        "Once there were about five minutes remaining in regulation the Stars really turned on the afterburners and were foiled several times on some prime chances by Freddie Andersen.The Stars would be afforded a crucial power play with just under three minutes remaining, in a game where the man-advantage was anything but effective.",
        "Kari Lehtonen was pulled with just over 90 seconds remaining to give the Stars a short-lived two-man advantage and the siege yielded some big chances -- but ultimate the effort late in the game was not going to be enough.The Stars once again put the pressure on Anaheim but costly turnovers and some rather unfortunate goaltending would be their downfall.",
        "The Stars now head back to Dallas facing a near-insurmountable 2-0 deficit in this series and now it's all about trying their hardest to make this interesting.We'll have further observations on this game later tomorrow."

I actually enjoy the relaxed egg hunts where the kids don't find all the eggs in under three minutes (like Matthew did this year). It's a lot more fun when it lasts a little longer!

        "In other words, I often say that what you fail to say in a non-toxic way will be said in a way that accomplishes very little in a marriage.Couples that will not say what they are thinking and feeling in a non-emotionally charged setting will typically end up expressing their frustrations in one or more of the following ways:YellingClamming upSarcastic statementsGiving the cold shoulderWithholding sexGiving the silent treatmentBlowing up about peripheral issuesWithdrawing into a shellPutting up wallsGrumpinessPortraying a closed spiritMore Work Now Means Less Work LaterCouples that struggle to communicate well are often lazy when dealing with issues.",
        "That is, rather than take the time to lovingly confront a matter or put everything on the table, they will often stuff down their feelings and continue as if nothing happened. The only problem is that what takes less work now usually means more work later.Couples that calmly deal with issues before they get messy find that they have to exert less strength and emotional effort to solve issues.",
        "Couples that wait until they have lost their temper or a problem has been blown way out of proportion have to exhibit much more energy in order to solve their issues.Proverbs 17:14Proverbs 17:14 says:“The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.”The interpretation is obvious.",
        "The Bible is telling us to deal with contention swiftly instead of waiting for a situation to get out of hand.The Heart of the MatterI once heard someone say that the heart of every matter is the heart. And, it should be noted that when a spouse is angry, short, rude, or contentious, they are often communicating something else. It is important to look to the heart of the matter and retrace a few steps.",

        "I have read Carmen’s autobiography before (Having a Ball), but for some reason I never got around to posting about this book, and the woman who wrote it (or, to be more honest, who had it written up for her). It was a frustrating time at the library.",
        "The copy of the Listener that has a review of her Red Mole Revue was missing, and the microfiche reel for the Dominion during the month Bob Jones orchestrated Carmen’s run at the mayoralty in 1977 had also disappeared..Driving home after my failed trip to the library I filmed this clip. Victoria, Vivian and Cuba Street were Carmen’s stomping grounds in Wellington in the 60s and 70s. She set up and closed down numerous businesses. The most famous were The Balcony and her International Coffee Lounge.",
        "None of these places exist anymore. Even the buildings are gone in most cases. The Egyptian, Carmen’s Down Town, Cleopatra’s Coffee Lounge, The Peacock.I went chasing ghosts.Here is an obituary from a friend of Carmen’s which made me sad, and here is a clip taken very recently.So long, Carmen.I hope they raise a glass for you on Vivian Street tonight.10 thoughts on “Carmen”I actually backed Red Mole people at The Balcony – they were doing a caberet thing. I played bass.",
        "I also visited The Balcony one night as a (rather pissed) guest.Seems like another lifetime now.I remember as a school-kid a few of us were out late one night after some kind of school do. We walked along Vivian Street and were peering through the doors of Carmen’s notorious establishment when she appeared from behind us and in a deep voice said “Good evening boys. Are you looking for some excitement, or should I say ‘Sexcitement’?” We skedaddled, no doubt to her amusement.R.I.P. Trevor.",
        "The world needs characters like youI remember that, as a college kid, it was a big deal to sneak past the Purple Onion and study the billboards with their photos of topless ladies whose breasts were strategically covered with stars. Hot stuff for a fifteen year old – I didn’t know anything about transvestites in those days.Carmen evidently had a great line for any male patron who might be in a troublesome mood,“Do you want a f**k or a fight?",
        "I can give you both.”Well, someone told me that’s what she sometimes said.Sure. Someone “told you”.So, Richard of RBB, which option did you choose?Stop picking on me, you lot!",
        "It wasn’t me.Before I left NZ I lived in a large 12 bedroom house in Moxham Ave that Carmen had owned in the late 1970s- which she apparently ran as a brothel- it is a magnificent house that feels like it’s lived the crazy wonderful life.This is really interesting to listen to:Wow, all I can say is that I lived a very sheltered existence as a kid in Scotland.. I had no idea that NZ was such a swinging, open society in the 60sNicola, yes. I was just reading about it in her book. It was a brothel.",
        "She has some good stories to tell about Moxham Ave.Good old Carmen. I tii recall her beign a prominent Wellington icon in my teenage days.I seem to recall she turend up topless to a meeting at the Wellignton racecousre in trentham once. Why? Becasue she could becasue seh was not technically a male. Ha ha.Carment was really one for pushing the boundaries. We hardly bat an eyelid when we see trannies around now, such is our crazy world."

        "Culture clashMovies | In Gran Torino, Clint Eastwood uses his icon status to successfully take on the sensitive subject of racismLeave it to Clint Eastwood to make a drama that generates more belly-busting laughs than most recent comedies and more insight into what drives and satisfies the human spirit than the majority of 2008's indie Oscar-bait put together.As Gran Torino's Korean War vet Walt Kowalski, Eastwood offers us a thoroughly unlikable character that manages, even in his unrepentant racism, to win our favor.",
        "He pulls this trick off by, first, realistically addressing the culture clashes that are as annoying as they are unavoidable in a melting pot like ours and, second, by depicting the ugly side of middle-class America just as much as he depicts the gang-violence typical of poor immigrant neighborhoods.",
        "It's not pretty, and neither is Walt, but he is made more so in that he doesn't pull punches no matter what group he's assaulting, even his own.But doling out punches (however deserved) is hardly a path to a fulfilling life.",
        "Once he is forced to interact with his Hmong neighbors, Walt finds that empty tolerance isn't the answer to overcoming differences; building real relationships is.Eastwood clearly understands what his persona as an actor has meant to American cinema, and with Gran Torino, he trades in on his icon status brilliantly. The gravel-voiced threat, the prolonged squint, the sotto voce snarl-all make regular appearances as Walt confronts gang-bangers of every ethnic stripe in his declining Detroit neighborhood.",
        "But rather than merely imparting an exhilarating sense of justice, these trademark elements are also used to cast light on some uncomfortable questions: Is clinging to every bit of nostalgic Americana really patriotic, or is it sometimes exclusionary? Do some immigrants fail to assimilate because they don't want to or because natural-born citizens fail to reach out to them?",
        "It is precisely because of his status as an icon of heartland masculinity that Eastwood is able to take on this sensitive subject with far more integrity (not to mention authenticity) than films like 2004's Crash managed.Gran Torinounquestionably earns it's R-rating with more obscenities and racial invective this side of a Quentin Tarantino movie. But unlike the films of lesser directors, the language here is rarely window dressing.",
        "Though a few exchanges strike a gratuitous note, it would be impossible to fully convey the spiritual evolution of the bitter, godless, and racist Walt Kowalski without making him sound, well, bitter, godless, and racist.",
        "In a twist that elevates Gran Torino far above the typical vengeance-wreaking flick, Walt discovers that the greatest satisfaction comes not from proving you were right but from sacrificing to right your wrongs.Gran Torino opens in theaters nationally, Friday, January 9.(Note: This movie review did not appear in the print edition of the Jan. 17, 2009, issue of WORLD, but is offered online as a Web Extra.)You must be a WORLD member to post comments."

        "doctor by training, she became national public health minister only to get booted from the Sadat administration and sent to prison for her antifundamentalist politics. In unabashedly didactic fiction and nonfiction that she began writing in her twenties, Saadawi applied her clinical impulse to eviscerating supposedly sacred systems of belief, ritual, economics, and psychology.",
        "Female genital mutilation is now sensationalistic fodder for CNN, but it was Saadawi who first held up a bloody fist in the 1970s and-speaking from her own childhood experience-called for the practice's end.",
        "Saadawi held her people accountable for how deeply sexual hypocrisies penetrate the national culture, outraging Egypt with matter-of-fact treatises on abortion, illegitimacy, female sexuality, wife-beating and humiliation, arranged marriages of girls to men, the complicity of women in perpetuating the misery of other women in order to reap the crumbs of men's power.",
        "In thanks she got her books banned, and in 1992 had to flee to escape fundamentalist death threats.It's hard to say more about Saadawi's career without hitting the library-her somber autobiography, A Daughter of Isis, ends before she's even out of medical school. That's perhaps a sign of good judgment.",
        "The same fierce sense of self and righteousness that have served her so well in her remarkable life are in plentiful supply here, better suited in their heroic sweep to fantastically outsized childhood memories than they would be to honest reflection on her career.",
        "It takes a little while to get cozy with this precocious girl, who lets it be known that at the age of nine or so, \"walking down the street was enough for me to hate all males, all boys and all men.\" Her unfashionably direct rage is certainly fathomable as she chronicles her young life as a nonperson, destined by birth to serve at the command of father, husband, and a constellation of aunts who have been delegated by custom and their own unhappiness to groom her for a life of servitude.Her mostly comfortable girldom in a Nile Valley village is punctuated by bouts of pain and humiliation.",
        "Dumped in a basin of water by a disgusted midwife. Pierced through the ears with a hot needle. Clitoridectomized, forcibly body-waxed, groped, paraded in front of suitors who \"one by one ...",
        "discovered that I loved the touch of the pen in my hand much more than the feel of the ladle or the handle of a broom, and so one by one they disappeared like the whiff of a gentle breeze in the night.\" With a doctor's compulsion to comprehend bodies, Saadawi lets her experiences flow through them-how her many aunts feel and smell, how her nipple aches when one of them pinches it (\"like the sting of a scorpion, or the bite of a snake\"-the pinch is supposed to bring good fortune in finding a husband), her experience of her first period, in which she was so desperate to get Allah's forgiveness that she bled all over, and thus desecrated a prayer rug.Saadawi wants to retrieve the female body, starting with her own, from the pit of shame into which her culture has cast it.",
        "Writing these memoirs while teaching at Duke, Saadawi persists, somewhat awkwardly, in trying to give her international feminist readers what she's heard them clamor for: a seamless account of oppression, in which women suffer demonstrable wrongs. But with the chance to write her own life, she also takes the opportunity to render her own experiences, which until now she has told in unshaded black-and-white, in full and complex color.",
        "Just six pages in Saadawi begins to recount her genital cutting, only to hesitate and say that she has not yet been able to bring herself to write fully about it. That isn't precisely true. She launches the first section of The Hidden Face of Eve, her unrelenting 1977 exposé of the place of women in Arab culture, with a memory of the experience as vivid as any six-year-old's could be expected to be.",
        "What's more, her account has her mother chatting and laughing with Nawal's aunts as she bleeds-a collaborator, not the well of inspiration to whom A Daughter of Isis is essentially dedicated.Reimagined in autobiography, Saadawi wields her self-mythology as something more than a political tool.",
        "If anything, she overcompensates in the opposite direction, adopting a dreamy, impressionistic voice that initially reads more like an unremarkable piece of personal anthropology than the life of someone who'd grow up to change her world.",
        "But though it takes too long to get there, once she moves from confusing atmosphere-setting to actually trying to figure out how a girl in her circumstances became an outlaw subversive, A Daughter of Isis becomes a striking study of the female ego in impossible circumstances. It ends up more consistent with the spirit of explanatory American feminists-Betty Friedan, Carol Gilligan, Surviving Ophelia-than with Saadawi's own polemics.Sponsor Content"

        "During Christmas season, the popular cake/ bread that is ordered from bakeries in Sri Lanka is the breuder. This is a speciality of the Burgher cuisine of Sri Lanka. I had been trying for some time to find someone to contribute a home-made recipe of this delicious bread. I was delighted to finally come across another blogger and invited him to share his family recipe on this blog as well.",
        "Here is the guest post of Paul van Reyk, from My Buth Kuddeh food site, with his introduction to his family tradition of baking breuder and his recipe. Wishing you all a merry Christmas!No Christmas at our house in Sri Lanka was complete without my grandmother’s breuder. It’s basically a cakey bread, based on a yeasted dough but with the sweetness of a sponge cake, related to Italian pannetone.",
        "It’s a direct entry into Sri Lanka cuisine via the Dutch Broodtulband named for the fluted ‘turban’ shaped mould used to make it. Further embedding the Dutch connection, brueder is traditionally eaten in Sri Lankan Burgher households in slices covered in butter and topped with a thick slice of Edam cheese. There is something very festive about that red waxy ball which sliced open reveals a pale European sun yellow cheese.",
        "Making the breuder, I am transported back to the kitchen of my childhood, watching my grandmother knead the dough, having the thrill of buttering the mould and pressing sultanas against the sides anxious that they stay in place, full of expectation as it was taken to my uncles house across the road as we didn’t have an oven, and then the excitement of un-moulding this magical transformation of so few ingredients hoping desperately that it comes away cleanly.",
        "The smile on grannie’s face when it does was more rewarding almost than the first bite into its soft, crumby heart.BreuderIngredients:- 500gms plain flour- 50 gms butter- baker’s yeast- 1 tsp sugar- water- 6 egg yolks- 250 gms caster sugar- 125 gms currants or sultanas or raisins or a mixture of themMethod:- Make the dough the night before.",
        "Take as much yeast as is recommended for your particular yeast for making bread with 500 gms of flour (it can vary so read the packet or ask when you buy it), add the yeast and the sugar to a little hot water to get the yeast started. It will froth slightly. When it’s bubbling happily, add this to the flour and mix in well. Now slowly add water and keep mixing until you have a lump of dough that lifts easily out of the bowl or off the board. Knead it for 10 minutes or so.",
        "Put it in a bowl, cover the bowl with a damp tea-towel and leave it in a warm place to rise overnight.- The next day, take the dough and add to it the butter, egg yolks and sugar. Add the first three yolks separately and mix in well each time. Then add the others also one at a time alternating with dollops of the caster sugar till it is all used up. What you will have now is a very thick wet doughy batter.- Butter a turban mould. Put a good sprinkle of whatever dried fruit you are using on the bottom.",
        "Squish some dried fruit against the sides of the mould, too. Pour in the batter. Sprinkle more of the dried fruit on top of the batter.",
        "If you like, and I do, you can mix some dried fruits into the batter, too.- Leave this in a warm place, the mould covered with a damp cloth, for 1 or 2 hours until it rises again (it won’t rise as much as the dough did overnight).- Meanwhile, pre-heat your oven to very hot – around 220C.- When the dough has risen the second time, put the mould in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Check at that stage that the breuder is cooked by poking a bamboo skewer or similar into the dough.",
        "If it comes out clean, your breuder is ready. If it doesn’t, give the breuder 10 – 15 minutes more.Tip: Putting some baking/greaseproof/brown paper on the top will reduce the likelihood of the dried fruit burning.- When it’s cooked, take it out of the oven and leave it to cool in the mould. You should then be able to give the mould a good thump and have the brooder come cleanly out of it.Resist all temptation to ice or otherwise muck around with the breuder!",
        "Just slice it up and have some butter and Edam or cheddar cheese to have it with. But you are allowed to make summer pudding with the left over breuder if you like, or indeed any of those bread pudding dishes.Recipe source: Paul van Reyk"

        "Temple Church is the only commanderie in England we have ever visited. Unlike in France, they aren’t so thick on the ground. Only guessing, but the lack of surviving commanderies may be a product of the way their lands were parceled out after the fall of the order, combined with the Reformation, which destroyed many, if not most, religious sites throughout Britain.",
        "The Templars in England were disbanded but were allowed to continue living, which is one of the significant differences between what happened to the Templars in England as compared to in France.Initially, the London Templars met at a location that had once been a Roman temple.",
        "But because of the rapid growth of the order since its founding in England in 1128, by the 1160s the site was too small, and the Templars established a larger monastic complex at Temple Church and made it their headquarters in England. In addition to the church, the new compound originally contained residences, military training facilities, and recreational grounds.",
        "The complex needed to be extensive to accommodate not only the numbers of knights but their novices, who were not permitted to go into the City without the permission of the Master of the Temple.As in France, the Knights Templar wielded enormous influence in England, with the Master of the London Temple sitting in parliament.",
        "Their compound was regularly used as a residence by kings and legates of the Pope, and served as an safety-deposit bank, much as the Paris Temple at one time stored the treasury for the French crown.The original church was consecrated in 1240 and is still visible today, consisting of a central aisle and two side aisles, north and south, of identical width. Looking up, the dome is just over 36 feet high.",
        "The church building itself has two separate sections: The original circular church building, called the Round Church, which now acts as a nave, and a rectangular section built later, which adjoins the nave on the east side, and which forms the chancel.That the church is round is a nod to Christian holdings in the Holy Land, which include the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Dome of the Rock, which (though Muslim in origin) had been turned into a Church by the Augustinians.",
        "Both were featured on Templar iconography throughout the Middle Ages. In addition, after the Crusaders took Jerusalem in 1099, the Templars made the mosque adjacent to the Dome of Rock their headquarters.In January 1215 William Marshall was instrumental in negotiating a treaty between King John and his barons at Temple Church, which resulted in Magna Carta. Marshall later became regent during the reign of John’s infant son, King Henry III. Henry later expressed a wish to be buried in the church.",
        "To accommodate this desire, in the early 13th century, the chancel of the original church was pulled down and a new larger chancel built, the basic form of which survives today. However, although one of Henry’s infant sons was buried in the chancel, Henry himself later altered his will to reflect his new wish to be buried in Westminster Abbey.",
        "William Marshal, on the other hand, as I said in last week’s video, himself became a Templar on his deathbed and was buried in the nave at Temple Church, and you can still see his tomb today."

        "We certainly haven't.Melbourne and South Sydney have kicked off the 2018 NRL finals in emphatic style with what we are boldly labelling the game of the season in a try-scoring fiesta that kept you on your toes for the full 80 minutes.MORE: Suliasi Vunivalu argues with touch judge while Greg Inglis strolls overWhen one team bashed someone in a tackle, the other hit back twice as hard.When one team took control, the other pulled out a magical play.And when one team had the lead, the other reeled it back.It was insane.",
        "It was first class entertainment. It was what we all were expecting.Of course it had to end with a field goal.",
        "The rugby league gods wouldn't allow it to happen any other way.Storm five-eighth Cameron Munster put the icing on the cake with a last-gasp one-pointer that sailed right down the centre of the uprights at AAMI Park, lifting the passionate crowd off their feet.The build-up play was even better, back-tracking to the old days of the Melbourne 'Big Three' with a signature inside, outside play that saw Billy Slater split the defence through a combination move with Munster and Smith.South Sydney looked to have caused a huge upset after Cameron Murray breezed his way through the defence in the 71st minute to give the away side a 28-22 lead.If it was the play that sealed the game, there could have been a major blow-up as the Bunnies were given a golden scoring opportunity through a dodgy forward pass ruling on Josh Addo-Carr.But the officiating is history and the Rabbitohs leave Melbourne without winning a game in their entire history at AAMI Park.They now await the winner of Brisbane and St George Illawarra on Sunday for a home final at ANZ Stadium next week."

        "National Bone Marrow Registry is Seeking DonorsAPPublished: October 13, 1987ST. PAUL, Oct. 12— Eight years after a Colorado girl received the first transplant of bone marrow from an unrelated donor, the first nationwide computer network for such transplants has been established at the University of Minnesota.The network, the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry, is trying to recruit 67,000 potential bone marrow donors from 50 blood centers nationwide and pool information on them, said Dr.",
        "David Stroncek, medical director of the registry's coordinating center.Information on potential recipients from 12 participating transplant centers across the country will be entered into a computer for possible matches, he said in a recent interview.''With the time it saves, it's going to save lives,'' said Sherry Graves of Fort Collins, Colo., whose daughter, Laura, underwent the world's first successful bone marrow transplant from an unrelated donor in 1979.",
        "''You're just lost unless you can find a suitable donor.''The girl received the transplant at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle after a three-month search for a donor, but she died after a recurrence of her leukemia in 1981, her mother said.The national registry is intended to help the people - about 60 percent of potential recipients - who cannot find a suitable donor within their own families, Dr.",
        "Stroncek said.People who need bone marrow transplants must find donors whose matching human leukocyte antigens, substances on the surface of their white blood cells, match their own. There are several basic antigen groupings which make matching bone marrow more difficult than matching blood types.Once matched with a recipient following a battery of tests, the potential donor will be hospitalized and placed under general anesthesia so marrow can be extracted from the pelvis.",
        "The extraction process takes less than an hour, but the donor stays in the hospital one night for observation.Bone marrow transplants help people suffering from leukemia, a blood cancer, as well as aplastic anemia and other diseases by replacing their cancerous blood cells or giving them new blood cells. Medical experts say the chances are about 1 in 20,000 of any two people matching.The national registry, which began operating last month, hopes to make its first match soon.",
        "It is the first nationwide computer network, although there have been computerized donor networks in several regions of the country.The registry is the latest development in a national trend toward better organization in matching organ donors and recipients.On Oct. 1, the United Network for Organ Sharing, a transplant umbrella group, began requiring the nation's 200 transplant centers to share certain kidneys.",
        "The requirement is a step toward possible nationwide sharing of all organs.''It's been mostly that each center had their own source of donors, so for these poor patients to get at all of these donors, they had to contact six or seven transplant centers and have each transplant center search its own little pool,'' Dr. Stroncek said.",
        "''It's been very frustrating for these families.''The problem is these diseases progress and they only have a limited amount of time to do the transplant, so if it drags out too long the person will die,'' he said.Ms. Graves said that after her daughter's death, her husband, Robert, handled his grief by trying to help others find donors.",
        "The agonizing searches he undertook, often unsuccessful, led him to testify before Congress on the need for a better system.The registry, financed with a three-year, $3.5 million grant from the Federal Government, is a collaborative effort of the American Red Cross, the American Association of Blood Banks and the Council of Community Centers, and is run by the St. Paul Red Cross Regional Blood Service.The registry will use past donors as recruiters.",
        "''We have donors regularly come and talk to people and they say what a great thing it was and that they're glad they did it,'' said Dr. Stroncek."

        "Ultra HD, Part II: Is it Soup Yet?True or False: Today’s HDMI 2.0 is ready for the everything Ultra HD might require.False. A specification of HDMI 2.0 does not always mean full capability HDMI 2.0. At least not yet.Full implementation of HDMI 2.0 involves not only compatibility with 4K at up to 60Hz (frames per second or fpstoday’s 4K, what little of it there is as yet, tops out at 30fps), but also the ability to handle other advances being considered for full, future implementation of Ultra HD.",
        "Most of these enhancements involve advanced color capabilities and are not yet included in any of the 4K material available to date.Technically, full implementation of HDMI 2.0 requires that the HDMI input pass data at a rate of 18 gigabits per second. That will allow it to handle all of the current and anticipated features of Ultra HD. But the more limited form of HDMI 2.0 passes only 10.2 Gb/sec. This is sufficient for 60p, but not for the other advanced UHD features.",
        "Some 4K sets may be ready now for all of these pending developments, but many are limited to the 10.2 Gb/sec data rate. You won't find this information in the spec sheet.True or False: Manufacturers will certainly inform us if full HDMI 2.0 is not present in their sets or other 4K-compatible devices (such as AV receivers).False. Manufacturers are traditionally reluctant to talk about things their products won’t do.",
        "We’ve already had questions about HDMI 2.0 compatibility deflected with blather about things like x.v.Color.True or False: But x.v.Color could be a big player in future Ultra HD developments.False. x.v.Color (also called xvYCC) was a system developed to expand the displayable colors without making additional demands on the transmission pipeline. It is not, strictly speaking, a defined color gamut, but merely a means to expand the color beyond the existing HD color gamut standard, REC709 (B.T.709).",
        "It was championed most strongly by Sony and included in the HDMI 1.3 specification. But to use it properly you need both a source encoded with it and a display that can recognize it.",
        "It has never become a big player in the display business, partly because the color space conversions required to make it compatible in all applications could produce unpredictable results (results not always in line with the intentions of the colorist who made the transfer and director who approved it).Apart from being incorporated in a few consumer camcorders, Sony’s “Mastered in 4K” discs, and some HDTVs, it’s now something of a technological dinosaur.",
        "The color enhancements we hear talked about for Ultra HD include a wider color gamut, but not x.v.Color.True or False: What’s the big deal about future compatibility. When the time comes, I can just download a firmware update to add all these new capabilities to the set.False: We’ve become so accustomed to fixing things with firmware updates that we think they’re a cure-all.",
        "It’s very possible that adding these future capabilities will mean major hardware changesand, possibly,a new set.True or False: So will that mean “Goodbye boat anchor, hello new TV?”Falseor at least we hope so. Predicting the future in our fast-moving tech universe is dicey, but hopefully manufacturers building today’s sets are aware of the need for backward compatibility. Orphaning millions of expensive 4K sets in two or three years would be a PR nightmare.",
        "One possible route could be an outboard converter box (or cable, satellite, and perhaps a future 4K blu-ray player) that will perform that task. That is, when the advanced color sources arrive, your current set will still display a good 4K image, but the advanced color also present in the source will simply be scaled back to fit the set’s capabilities.",
        "You won’t see the new color, but will merely “meet the new color, same as the old color.” Such compatibility must also be a major item on the agenda for finalizing the advanced color gamut for Ultra HD. The leading candidate at present is the DCI (P3) (Digital Cinema Initiative) gamut, shown in the diagram above. While there are proponents of the even wider gamut (Rec.2020, also shown), it might not be possible to achieve this with current video technology.",

People and vehicles jostled for space as cars honked to get their attention. The sun beat hard and various bodies glistened with sweat. A conductor hung precariously on a yellow J5 bus as he shouted his destination at the top of his croaky voice. Passengers shoved each other to get into the bus.“Na five five oh. Madam, dress.",
        "I say na five five.” The conductor shouted at a woman in the bus.Within a few minutes, the bus was filled and the conductor tapped the roof of the bus to signal to the driver that they were ready to move.A woman who was seated by the window at the back seat of the bus called a pure water vendor. She collected a satchet from the young boy and paid for it. As she bit the bag with her teeth to tear open a small portion, she dipped her head out of the bus and started to wash her face with the water.",
        "I was seated next to the woman and I noticed that as she put her head back into the bus, there was an expression of surprise and regret on the face of the bus conductor.A hand appeared from outside and was on the woman’s neck. The woman held on to the gold chain on her neck but the guy who later showed his face was faster. As he pulled the gold chain, the man who sat beside me stretched his hand over me and tried to stop the thief.",
        "His outstretched hand came face to face with a shining metal and he withdrew his hand immediately. He did not want to get stabbed. Everything happened in the twinkling of an eye.As the bus moved forward, the conductor said to the woman. “Madam, shine your eyes oh. You no dey do that kain thing for inside market. If you wear gold, you go comot am once you enter market.”The man scolded the conductor. “Didn’t you see him when he was coming?",
        "You no fit tell her?”“Oga, she don put her head outside already nau and dem don see the chain. If I talk, dem go know say na me tell her.As the journey proceeded, the woman mourned the loss of her chain. While some passengers sympathized with her, others began to tell various incidents of robbery in the market.——Photo Credit:"

One team of 75 protects a pole. One team of 75 needs to tear it down. Yep, those numbers are correct.",
        "Holy freaking yes!Simple terms: Tear down the pole, let none stand in your way.Sport # 4 – OctopushWhat is it? How Sean Connery says “Octopus”Simple terms: Underwater hockey with snorkels and the constant threat of drowning.Sport # 5 – Equestrian VaultingWhat is it?

        "Department circuits mounted for new equipment installations are required to provide an gadget grounding conductor sized in accordance with 250.122 for grounding the non–current-wearing metallic elements.I purchased a brand new 3 pronged cable from home depot.

        "The simplest difference between the brand new standard (1996 to offer) receptacle which is a 14-30r - four twine 30amp/240 volt and the 10-30r - 3 cord 30amp/240 volt receptacle is the lacking ground pin.

        "Placed lower back the 4 prong twine that got here with the dryer - make certain no bond from white to floor and be performed with it - value is minimum and a far neater and safer manner to do it.

        "You'd think the voice behind the galaxy's worst dad would be a little biased when it comes to playing favorites in 'Star Wars.' When Moviefone caught up with James Earl Jones to hear his thoughts on the upcoming 'Star Wars: The Complete Saga' Blu-ray release, however, the acclaimed actor revealed that Darth Vader wasn't Darth Vader's favorite character.\"Chewbacca is my favorite,\" Jones said by phone to great nods of approval in Moviefone HQ.",
        "Read on to find out why Jones thinks Darth Vader has remained such a powerful presence during the last four decades, how his Governors Award acceptance speech is coming along, and what it's like having 'Dr. Strangelove' as his first starring role.Why do you think the voice of Darth Vader has remained so powerful over the course of 30 years?Well, a hidden voice, a hidden face creates a lot of mystery. It leaves everything up to the audience's imagination.I had an unusual experience not too long ago.",
        "There was a lady from Finland, a doctor, who had a theater in Washington, D.C. where she put masks on young, impaired children. And there was a narrator, so all the kids had to do was come out and face each other, make certain gestures, and these faces were the only things you would look at. You weren't bothered by their impairment, so it freed your imagination as to who's talking behind that mask.",
        "The same thing happens with Darth Vader.Besides it being scary, perhaps, you're also freed from having to be impressed by what he looks like. Your imagination can go wild.So is Darth Vader your favorite 'Star Wars' character?Chewbacca is my favorite.What a great choice!",
        "My co-workers are all nodding their heads in approval.[Laughs] Oh, really?So are you excited or nervous for your Governors Award at this year's Oscars?My wife and I have not stopped cheering with joy yet, so we haven't really had the chance to be nervous. And I also say that the award goes to the whole village because they've done as much for it as I have.I think you're selling yourself a bit short there.Well I'm very proud of it.How's the acceptance speech coming along?Oh, I hope to say very little.",
        "[laughs]Alright, one more question. What's it like having 'Dr. Strangelove' as your big-screen debut?Well I think what made it a cult hit was the universities, young people on college campuses, because the military didn't like that movie.",
        "It was too much of a put-down and the population was very pro-military then, so nobody said, \"Oh, that's my favorite movie.\" But the young kids did and this was before counter-culture, too.When your humor has to come out of a dignified officer shooting a Coke machine, I was like, \"Come on, are we back in 'Animal House?'\" I didn't know whether I wanted to take that seriously or not, but that's a kind of humor that [screenwriter] Terry Southern was into back then.",
        "I worked with him on something else later, but I wasn't really sure if I recommended that as a level of sense of humor.But it wasn't a sense of humor, I guess, it was something else -- a sense of irony, a sense of cynicism, and all that we needed to replace the worship of war. And we still need it, I guess.So who's the better 'Star Wars' character: Vader or Chewie?Photo courtesy of Steve Granitz/WireImage.com.CATEGORIES Movies, Interviews"

        "Keith Primeau is one of those athletes that one watches when they want to learn about the nuances of sport. Tall and sinewy like a forward in basketball, it’s plain to see that Primeau will do almost anything if it means that his hockey team will win one more game. Whether it’s his off-ice preparation spent with hours on the stationary bike in the team’s training room, or with lap after monotonous lap up and down the bleacher steps in the Wachovia Center after a game, count on Primeau doing the work.",
        "Don’t exclude the team-bonding grunt work, either. As the Flyers’ captain, Primeau takes on the responsibility of helping a new teammate find a place to stay and showing him around his new town. He also organizes the team parties, gauges the team’s mood and acts as an intermediary with the coaches and team brass, and has the thankless task of being front and center for the press every day.",
        "“I learned a long time ago that my job is not just to perform on the ice,” Primeau said in an interview a few years ago. “So much more goes into your professional being as a hockey player. Media relations, public relations – I accept this. If I can deflect some of the attention away from the younger guys and allow them to play, I’ll do that.” The same goes for the intangibles on the ice, as well.",
        "In that regard, Primeau is one of those players whose true worth is not seen in the every day box scores. Maybe he’ll block a goalie’s view by positioning himself just so in the slot so that Simon Gagne can blast one. Maybe he can deliver a check that pries the puck loose in the offensive zone to set up a goal. Or maybe he can sense that the team needs a pick-me-up and gets into a fight.",
        "One instance of Primeau picking a fight that stands out more so than any other was the little tête-à-tête with the Devils’ Randy McKay in Game 2 of the 2000 Eastern Conference Finals. During the second period where New Jersey was skating circles around the Flyers and were on the verge of taking a 2-0 lead in the series, Primeau took the bumping with McKay as an invitation to do something.",
        "So before the crowd at the First Union Center (that’s what the building was called back then) knew what happened, Primeau dropped his gloves, rolled up his sleeves, checked to make sure his helmet was fastened and called McKay out. It wasn’t important whether or not Primeau beat McKay. The message was loud and clear. “I thought our team needed a spark,” Primeau said at the time. But that scrap came barely a week after Primeau suffered a concussion in a game in Pittsburgh.",
        "Though he was carted off the ice on a stretcher and rushed to the hospital after taking a big hit from Pittsburgh’s Bob Boughner, Primeau missed just one game and envisioned his wife. “I’m a father and a husband, but at the same time I’m a hockey player… “ Maybe that’s why Primeau has merely decided to put his career on hold six years and at least three head injuries later. He is a hockey player.",
        "In fact, Primeau still had not decided whether he was going to shut it down for the season just a day before his emotional press conference last Tuesday. Primeau says he is sitting out with the hope of prolonging his career, which is a great. It’s hard not to root for a man like Primeau. But when he admitted that he still had post-concussion symptoms from the head injury he suffered last Oct. 25, maybe the writing is on the wall.",
        "In fact just the term concussion softens what the affliction really is – medical people call them traumatic brain injuries. Needless to say, multiple brain injuries could result in the most of dire circumstances. Still, we hope that Primeau can recover in time for training camp next September, and we hope to see him back out there on the ice real soon. But not at the expense of being a father and a husband."

        "This paper describes the use of Cambridge Weight Plan Low energy liquid diet (800kcal/d) as an initial intervention to achieve weight loss in people with pre-diabetes based in eight centres around the globe*.",
        "The initial weight loss was intended to prepare subjects prior to a three year weight maintenance and lifestyle intervention intended to prevent diabetes.Of 2224 (of whom 1504 were women) participants who were overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2) with prediabetes (according to ADA** criteria) who commenced the dietary programme 204 dropped out (10.1% of women, 7.2% of men). The overall mean weight loss after 8 weeks was 10.7 + 0.4kg (10.8% of body weight).",
        "After eight weeks women lost 10.2kg and men 11.8kg body weight on average of which 3.2kg (31%) and 1.9kg (16%) were fat free mass respectively (FFM – lean mass).After 8 weeks 35% of participants were no longer ‘pre-diabetic’ but among those with slightly higher baseline blood glucose levels (using WHO criteria***) and who achieved a ‘successful’ weight loss of 8% or more, nearly two-thirds were no longer ‘pre-diabetic’.",
        "Systolic blood pressure was ‘normalised’ in women, down 7 mmHg from 127mmHg and nearly normalised in men, down 8mmHg from 133mmHg. Blood lipid profiles were largely improved, fasting blood glucose and insulin were reduced and insulin sensitivity was significantly improved.Metabolic syndrome was less severe in the group as a whole after 8 weeks LED diet.",
        "Adverse events were reported in detail, 7.6% of participants complained of constipation despite the advice to avoid this from the beginning by using bulk laxatives, 2.0% complained of dizziness and no cases of gout occurred in any of the women, but six cases in men. Establishing meaningful rates for low-frequency adverse events requires that large subject numbers be studied and this data-set enables meaningful rates to be quoted (see table).",
        "After the initial weight loss period those who achieved 8% weight loss were entered into a randomised trial of higher and lower dietary protein intake, higher and lower dietary glycaemic index levels and higher and lower physical exercise levels for three years. The results of the three year maintenance outcomes will be presented at the European Diabetes meeting (EASD) in Berlin in October 2018.",
        "Commenting on the resultsProfessor Anthony Leeds, medical director of Cambridge Weight Plan said ‘This large observational study of Cambridge Weight Plan Low energy diet (800kcal/d LED) shows for the first time, in a global context, that this is a safe, effective way to begin diabetes prevention programmes.

        "“I was the luckiest girl in the world,” she said.They met in March 2012 and were married by the following March. They rented an apartment near Jacksonville Beach and began to plan their life.“We wanted to wait a little while to have children and enjoy each other a little first,” she said. “After all, we had the rest of our lives.”Soon after their marriage, Johnny Oliver’s unit shipped out to Bahrain.The U.S.",

        "All you have to do is look at him and you know he’s American,” she said.What happened on May 7, 2013, the day her life changed, still hasn’t been resolved.“Basically what happened was he’d just gotten off work and changed his clothes and was going to dinner with friends,” she said.",

        "Before You Pitch Yourself to Speak: Part 2 - Know Your AudienceBefore you start pitching yourself to speak at all the creative conferences you need to know who it is you are called to serve. In our last post on “What You Need to Have Before You Pitch Yourself to Speak” we walked through crafting your compelling presentation Topic, Title and Takeaways. Today we’re taking that one step further and determining who your ideal audience is.Why does this matter?",
        "To put it simply, we are not meant to speak at EVERY event. By determining who we’re supposed to serve, it becomes easier to intentionally seek out speaking opportunities to pitch.So maybe you’re saying, “But Jess, I know my topic like the back of my hand. I could deliver this to ANYONE!”Technically, you could. But should you? No.Not sure why your audience is so important? Let me paint the picture for you, friend.Meet “Stephanie.” Stephanie is a successful business coach.",
        "Everyone knows her as the go-to person for helping her clients increase sales and convert like crazy!She’s been seeing great success with her online based business and is ready to start expanding her market. Speaking is on her radar and she’s anxious to hit the stage and share her expertise with even more people. She gets a phone call: “Hi Stephanie! Our speaker for tomorrow’s event just cancelled last minute. Tom says you’re the go-to sales expert!",
        "Are you able to step in and speak tomorrow?”Stephanie: “Ab-so-freakin-lutely!”Steph is PUMPED! She pulls an all-nighter working on the perfect slide deck. Beautiful pink, floral, gold foiled slides - check! She compiles the best strategies she’s been using with her clients (who are female online business owners) and she is certain her audience will gush over these floral flat lays and script fonts.Tomorrow arrives before she knows it and it's time for the event.",
        "She walks into the room ready to crush it...And then reality hits....This is a sales training event for realtors and the audience mostly men.The problem? She works exclusively with women-owner online businesses and knows nothing about the real-estate industry. Stephanie never thought to ask about the audience.",
        "She agreed to speak at this event only knowing they needed a sales expert and she assumed she fit the part!Stephanie is quietly kicking herself thinking about how she stayed up all night long working on a presentation (and slide deck) that is completely wrong for this audience.But it's too late to back out now.She steps onto the stage.... in front of a room full of 40-something year old male realtors.",
        "The butterflies fill her stomach as she hesitantly advances to her first hot pink powerpoint slide.I think it's safe to assume these gentlemen didn't care for her floral-filled training on converting sales in Facebook Groups with Virtual Coffee Dates.Knowing, Identifying and Understanding Your Audience is EssentialDon't be like Stephanie... Ask questions! When we're presented with a speaking opportunity its' completely normal for our excitement to show through.",
        "The problem occurs when that excitement results in one of two things:(1) Act too soon: This is what Stephanie did. She didn't take the time to evaluate the situation, ask questions and determine if this even was good fit or not. Her excitement took over and she immediately jumped to an “Ab-so-freakin-lutely!”(2) Word Vomit: Sometimes when we're so excited we just can't. stop. talking. We want to tell the organizer ALL about our experience, our presentation and how fantastic the event will be.",
        "What we think comes across as \"excitement\" can easily be misinterpreted as flat out rude. Slow down and ASK more than you tell. Find out how you can support the organizer rather than TELLING them how great you're going to be. This one can be difficult to manage sometimes, but it's crucial.",

When we fail to see the grand transcendence and absolute dignity of the human person, violence, disrespect and injustice will assuredly increase.",
        "Apart from its theological dimensions, religion is a vital force for social good.The Catholic Church embraces a remarkably consistent life ethic, condemning both abortion and capital punishment, carefully laying out the criteria for a war to be considered just, proclaiming the peace and reconciliation won for us through the cross and resurrection of Christ. Yet many people in our society see the aforementioned forms of violence as not only acceptable, but as beneficial.",
        "As long as the death of another person, whether it is a child in the womb, a prisoner on death row or an “enemy” of some sort is seen as a good thing, we are still shackled by the chains of the culture of death.Hollywood will continue to churn out films of graphic violence and pornographic sexuality as long as they are financially lucrative. Legislators and presidents will continue to protect state-sanctioned abortion as long as they perceive it to be in their political self-interest.",
        "Inner city neighborhoods will continue to be wracked by murders and drugs as long as everyone thinks “that is not my problem.”In other words, the culture of death will continue to flourish as long as we collectively allow it to by remaining indifferent, by feeding it our entertainment dollars, by accepting violence as normal, by not articulating and proclaiming the Gospel of Life.",
        "Peace, respect, reconciliation and justice are hard work and can only be sustained by a proper understanding of the human person as worthy of absolute respect, as the proper end of all human activity. All violence, scape-goating and victimization end in the cross of Jesus Christ. By surrendering himself to death, the Son of God subverts all forms of human manipulation, the using of another for one’s own selfish gain.",
        "Where the culture of death takes the life of another for some perceived gain, Jesus offers his life, so that we can all gain together the saving love of God and the reconciliation of a world redeemed.The Gospel of Life offers us a breath-taking vision of human flourishing, solidly rooted in the proper understanding of the person, created in the image and likeness of God, redeemed by the Son and sanctified in the Holy Spirit.",

Wrong, completely wrong.Cultured meat is happening right now. In fact, it has already happened. The first in vitro hamburger was served in 2013 in London. The two year project was highly complicated and not economically sustainable, with the final price totaling a hefty $325,000. But what did the lucky few selected to taste the burger have to say?",
        "Their biggest complaints were that the burger didn't taste the same as one that comes from grazing livestock, and it was a bit dry.Despite the burger falling short on the taste and consistency fields, hopefuls still see the potential and are trying to obtain more funding for their research.",
        "If more support and funding is provided, the concept can become large scale, allowing the price to drop and more types of \"meat\" to be created.I use the term \"create,\" but of course I must mention that many, if not most, creationists would be completely against not only the research, but the concept itself. Many believe that growing meat goes against what is natural.",
        "Creating meat in a test tube, adding our own flavoring, vitamins and additives would be overstepping our boundaries or even \"playing God.\" There are even people who have gone as far as saying that it would be equivalent to serving up zombies on a plate.It's buffoonery to go as far as calling the meat \"zombie production\", but how can the accusation be challenged when there are companies like BiteLabs arising? The company's basis is to produce salami made of tissue samples from celebrities.",
        "Gut reaction says that this is disturbing, and, more alarmingly, cannibalistic. But is it, really?Challenging the traditional definition of cannibalism, it is decidedly not. The production and consumption of the salami would take place between two (or more, no judgement here) consensual adults. It would also fail to violate any U.S. laws against murder or body desecration. Maybe it's skin crawling and socially unacceptable, but I wouldn't go as far as to call it cannibalism.",
        "All Sweeney Todd jokes aside, if forced to use the word cannibalism, I'd say it is a form of \"humane cannibalism,\" if anything.This argument presents a problem in itself, though. Since in vitro meat production is such a challenging and fairly newly researched topic there are many gray areas and questions posed that are difficult to answer because of how our society views the ideas of life, naturalism, cannibalism and humane treatment of animals.",
        "For in vitro meat to be a success, these terms must be redefined or at least understood in relation to factory grown meat.Educational briefings and infographics would have to be readily available for the public, or they would simply not understand what it is they would be eating and would be against the meat replacement.",
        "If people aren't able to understand and accept that factory grown meat follows the same development process that meat from traditional livestock does, they will not back the introduction of the meat into the market.Researchers behind the factory meat growing process also present the argument that in vitro meat would technically qualify as a vegan food.",
        "Part of this idea is because it would be cruelty free and a non GMO product.The vegan-friendly argument is backed by PETA, who introduced a $1 million contest in 2008. The rules of the contest laid out that the company who was able to produce the first marketable in vitro chicken meat would receive the prize.Unfortunately, no one was successful before the deadline arrived, and the prize money went towards combating animal cruelty in today's meat production process.",
        "PETA still considered the contest to be a raging success, though, based on the leaps and bounds made in the research and understanding of in vitro meat.As someone who practices vegetarianism, I can see both sides of the argument. Yes, there would be cruelty-free meat available, which is a benefit that conquers a few issues vegetarians and vegans have with industrial livestock productions.",
        "It wouldn't offer a solution, though, to diehards who are not simply skipping out on meat products because they promote animal cruelty.Some, such as Pennsylvania State University environmental resource management sophomore and environmental sustainability enthusiast Emily Newman, will not be supporting the endeavor, cruelty free or not.When asked if she would ever find herself eating cultured meat, Newman, who has been a vegetarian for nearly two years and even practiced veganism for a brief period said, \"No, definitely not.",
        "Food comes from the ground. The earth is giving it to us. We can utilize it. That's it, no need for anything to be grown in a lab.\"Most vegetarians and vegans would hold the same standard.",
        "To suggest that cultured meat would be vegan friendly is to redefine the core values which people who practice a plant based diet hold themselves to.I, however, am a big fan of the idea, not because I would find myself chowing down on some factory grown burgers or shoveling test tube bacon in my mouth, but because people who see meat as a necessity for every meal, the people who are hurting our environment and relishing in their poor health habits, will finally be able to contain their socially and environmentally poisonous behavior.Personally, I'm still holding out for the real wave of the future- the Spy Kids' food Rehydrator, or the Star Trek Food Replicator.",
        "Until the glorious day comes when they're introduced, in vitro meat will have to do, and I'm looking forward to it's mass introduction, societal acceptance and growth within the next few decades.Reach the columnist at mjrodr11@asu.edu or follow her on Twitter @mikayrodr."

        "It was what I suppose could be described as a science fiction novel set in a future Britain.

It was however, another 17 years before I did.The Roman period in Britain had always been my favourite period of history and the novels of Rosemary Sutcliff and especially her Eagle of the Ninth trilogy had been my favourites.",
        "My interest in the Roman period had been revitalised when in the mid-1970s my wife Lynne and I had holidayed on the Isle of Wight and visited the Roman villa at Brading.After that visit, I started to study the Roman period in Britain, reading every book on the subject that I could and believe me when I say there are a great many of them.",
        "We also joined the Association for Roman Archaeology and I would scour the ARA News (the Associations journal) whenever I was sent one for news of any new finds or discoveries.When we returned from holiday I started to write my second novel, a historical novel based in Roman Britain. I was only able to write at weekends, having a full-time career in learning Disability Day Services at the time and it took several years to write.",
        "When it was finally finished in the early 1990’s I sent it off to a publisher and also entered in in a contest. It was unsuccessful. At about that time I was promoted and found I had even less time to write and so the novel was virtually forgotten and I didn’t write again, until I retired eight years ago.About a year after I’d retired, our local newspaper was asking if anyone was interested in doing guest columns for the newspaper.",
        "I applied and was successful and for two I wrote a fortnightly column for them. Getting back into writing again spurred me on to trying to attempt to write a novel again. I’d kept the manuscript of the novel I’d written back in the 1990s and rewrote it. I finished the novel which was Divided Empire the first in the series I’m now writing and submitted it to Endeavour Press, who to my utmost surprise decided to publish it.",
        "I then wrote Dark Betrayal, the second in the series which is also published by Endeavour Press.Research for my novels has always been very important to me, as I try to ensure that my novels are as accurate to the times as they can possibly be. The problem for me is that sometimes the research can take precedence over my writing.",

I came across a book called ‘Britain: Rome’s Most Northerly Province’, by G.M.Durant.",
        "It was first published in 1969, although I think it is out of print now and so I was fortunate to get hold of it. Durant puts forward the theory that the Attecotti, or Attacotti as they are also known, were an Irish tribe from the district around Ath-Cliath, a place the Vikings were later to call Dublin. This tied in with my storyline for the novel and so that’s where they’ll be based.Brian J Kitchen# # #"

        "Halloween is usually a night when a kid’s top goal is to collect as much candy as humanly possible. But a trio of young trick-or-treaters in Rhode Island who came upon an empty candy bowl on a neighborhood porch this year surprised the woman who’d left it there in the best possible way.Kristen Wells, of Westerly, R.I., decided to leave a bowl of treats on her front step as she took her own children out to trick or treat. She left a note on the front door with instructions on how much candy to take.",
        "“Please take 2. Leave the rest for another guest. Happy Halloween!” the note read.The bowl was filled to the top with chocolate bars, which is shown in a photo Wells shared on Facebook.Upon coming home, though, Wells found something unexpected in her nearly empty candy bowl.“When we came home, it was dark,” Wells told Providence-based WJAR-TV. “We were going in the house, I looked in the bowl [and] there were a few pieces.",
        "It wasn’t any of the type of candy that we have, so I’m like confused like, ‘How did this get here?'”Luckily, Wells has a security camera above her door, which she used to solve the mystery of this unexplained candy. After seeing a number of children take too many pieces from the bowl, Wells noticed three kids do something unexpected on her porch.",
        "When the costumed trio came upon the empty bowl, they took candy out of their own stashes and dropped them in for other trick-or-treaters to enjoy!You can even hear them banter as they decide what to do.After at first deciding to turn the bowl upside down so that other trick-or-treaters know it’s empty, one of the kids comes up with the generous solution.“Guys, we should put some candy there … for other trick-or-treaters,” one of them says.",
        "Although one of his friends balks at that suggestion, the other one agrees and two of them deposit some sweets from their own bags.After being pleasantly surprised by the unexpected moment, Wells was disappointed she had no idea who the generous children were. She wanted to recognize their good deed, so she first posted the story without the video so the neighborhood would know what happened.",
        "Then, she added a screenshot of the trick-or-treaters to see if anyone could identify them by their costumes.“I’d love to send the video to their parents and maybe get permission to share the video,” Wells wrote in her initial post.",
        "“After all the posts I’ve seen about kids taking entire bowls, I think even more that this story needs to be shared.”Fortunately, the kids’ parents did see the post and gave permission to Wells to share the video on Facebook.The clip caught the attention of the local news channel who asked to talk to the boys.Jack Binger and Jackson Panciera, both age 10, and their friend, 11-year-old Andrew Kitchen, chatted with WJAR about the generous moment that was caught on camera.“We walk up, none of us looked down at the bowl yet, we all just standing there reading the sign to ourselves and then we all looked down at the exact same time and we’re like — ‘There was nothing’,” Andrew told the station.",
        "“We started to walk away and then [Jack] says, ‘You know, we should put some candy in there for other trick-or-treaters’.”What made the boys decide to do it?“I was like, ‘Guys, we should put in candy because there could be other trick-or-treaters that could come by,” said Jack.",
        "“Honestly, we’re all done with COVID and candy is the best thing we could do to help everyone.”Not only did these boys help make other kids’ Halloween night a little sweeter, their actions also brightened up a world that can use a little happiness.This story originally appeared on Simplemost.

        "The Olympics should perhaps be dedicated to him, like they were dedicated to Zeus in old times.To get you a quick idea about how amazing, fit and absolutely mind-bogglingly stunning Michael Phelps is, check out this tweet.Can you believe you share your lifespan with someone who has broken a 2168 years old world record?! What is it that makes Phelps so astoundingly awesome?So what makes Michael?The world was stunned when his performance in the Athens Olympics got him as many as 6 Gold medals.",
        "In Beijing, he scored 8, and in London in 2012, he scored another 4 gold medals! This time, Rio has seen him win 4 golds in the Olympics. And the question on everybody’s mind is, how does he do it?Well, the answer isn’t exactly straight. What makes any athlete great?",
        "It is the constant commitment to excel at their sport, the perseverance to keep up the training even when you’re down in the dumps, the willpower to eat healthy even when it is your birthday and the all-you-can-eat-buffet is calling you with its delicious arms wide open. But even among the best of athletes, Michael Phelps is extra-ordinary.At 31, Phelps is quite the exception to the usual swimmers career chart.",
        "Most swimmers make hay when they’re in their 20s, and retire out by the time 30 is around the corner. If not, their performance dips till it becomes unfeasible to continue the sport.",
        "Given the expensive nature of professional competitive swimming, where you need to keep your diet rich, get tons of exercise under a professional coach and how it is impossible to work an everyday job to pay for it all, with over 35 hours per week going into the training, it can be tough to follow the dream.Phelps has help in the money front as well. And with the amount of sponsorship money that an everyday athlete can receive, it can certainly aid in the journey to be the best.",
        "Not many appreciate Michael’s shifty gait or see beyond a perceived clumsiness. But the man has quite a fan following across the world. From doing ads for popular brands like Omega, Subway and Speedos to the medals he wins by the pile every Olympic Games and in between, every bit of money and recognition serves to supercharge the athlete to give his absolute best.Michael Phelps Body StructureSwimmers know that not all athletes are born the same.",
        "Your body’s design, your height, even the amount of body hair can play a role in how quick you’re going to be in the pool. Michael Phelps is blessed in this department as well; his longer arms, shorter feet and double jointed knees serve him well. Some compare his feet to flippers, because they can turn a whopping 15 degrees more than the average human’s.",
        "And with the sort of workout regime Phelps follows, there is no chance of a race against Phelps being an easy battle.Michael Phelps Workout RegimeMichael Phelps’ regime is pretty tough. Glance through it and you can see the amount of overwhelming detail. Michael Phelps’s workout shows you the amount of dedication you need to bring yourself to the level of readiness to win gold medals one after another.",
        "It’s no easy workout regime either.Check out WorkOutInfoGuru to read the entire plan with extensive detail.Michael Phelps DietSwimming can be pretty draining. Pushing your body through the water can be tough, and with Michael’s workout and zeal to beat the competition, his diet needs to be taken care of. You’ll be surprised how much this strapping hunk who’s fit like a greek god can guzzle down in just one meal. His calories? Phelps eats 12,000 calories per day!",
        "All the foods that you’re told to keep off of because you’re going to get fat, remember those? Phelps eats several portions of each of them. His fast body metabolism is only a small portion of his nutritional needs; Michael burns calories by the dozen!Credits:Have a look at Michael Phelps’s everyday diet on Muscle ProdigyAlso, if you’re wondering what Michael Phelps’s favorite cereal is, you’re welcome.What’s your fav cereal??",
        "Mine is life or Cinnamon Toast Crunch #ctc #NationalCerealDay— Michael Phelps (@MichaelPhelps) March 7, 2016There’s obviously not a lot of wisdom in mimicking someone’s workout plan unless a qualified trainer tells you to. But it does get you an idea about the level of dedication you need to have to excel at fitness. If you think you’re doing everything necessary to be the best in health and fitness, take it from Michael Phelps’s routine that there’s a scope for more.",

Oct. 6, 2008, which was before the management buyout of Neuberger Berman. Thanks. Best, Rich \"I just don't understand the big difference...",
        "I GUESS it is a Big Deal to Somebody because that POST was hit by Lehman Brothers, Warner Brothers, Rubbenstein and Associates, emailed to Stock Brokers and Holding Companies, hit and studied by Proskauer Rose LLP, and lit up on Blackberry and Verizon, it was a bit of a frenzy and I just don't get it when it was on the Web for 15 Months before I linked to it in my research connecting the dots on Proskaur Rose , Which was the Research that I was doing.How can it NOW be such a Big Deal and why do they want that changed, and on whose authority of fact?I mean when did the Deal Really Close and Who really Cares?",

But, I am not certain whether it was a human or an elephant').Lord Krishna also knew that it was not possible for Dharma to lie outright.",

        "Brink seems to be all the rage today, and that makes sense cause it just got released on.. I think today?As far as I know you guys in America got it today, but then I saw a comment on raptr... some guy said he'd been playing it all weekend? Anyways, it only comes out on the 13th for those of us in the U.K. I pre-ordered it about a week ago, against my better judgement.FF XIII was the first game I ever pre-ordered, but Im an FF Fanboy so of course I did that.",
        "You see, like a lot of people, I tend to get games way after their release and by that point I always know if the game is for me or not.But then I get the feeling that I missed out on discovering the game's quality for myself.",
        "Also, there's so many games I don't take chances on that turn out to be awesome, and then I never get around to buying them and then the sequel comes out and everyone's all like \"oh my god so good!\" and Im like \"shit I should have gotten into this earlier and now Im way behind!\".In this case however, I knew that I shouldn't bother getting Brink cause it would just be a fail. But then I saw those tutorial/ads and thought it was clever, and my idea of the game changed.",
        "Sooooo, I pre-ordered it, excited about the fact that I'd get to form a completely untainted opinion about it. The way it should be.I was telling my friend this same thing just before I got back to my flat to see the sparkling 'D' 1up gave it. I had no idea it was being released in America a few days earlier than here so I have to say dammit 1up! I got no heads up on that. Obviously 1up isn't to blame, Ill just have to be wary of these things the next time I want a fresh and unexpected gaming experience.",
        "Things like different release dates and the fact that gaming sites tend to review games. It probably didn't help that I chose to read the whole review too.I now know not to get my hopes up, so I also have to say thanks 1up. I heard that a lot of people who pre-ordered Brink had jumped ship. But not me. Im still determined to play it and maybe even enjoy it. I was also planning on giving my initial thoughts about it on here when I did finally play it but no ones gonna need to read that anymore.",
        "Soo, I just want to say a couple things before we rap up this post.One thing I really like about this game is that Bethesda gave a shout out to their other (probably better) games in the form of the pre-order packages that, depending on where you ordered from, gives you exclusive customised skins, armour etc. There are four of these: the DOOM pack, the Fallout pack, the Spec ops pack and the Psycho pack.",
        "That last one as far as I know is the only one not connected to an already existing game.The other thing I like is that one of the characters looks like Altair or Ezio found themselves in 'Attack the Block' (Pic below). Cloths that conceal the identity of the character but are reasonable attire for free running in make him a cool lookin' character while at the same time having a reason to look cool.",
        "Too bad the game doesn't make better use of the S.M.A.R.T system and free running....- This guy deserves to be in a good game, maybe Brink 2 will do him justice -"

        "Just a fantasy wish list about gearing up the A6M5 Zero, for late-war fights.1) Kinsei 62 EngineThe Zero really needed an engine upgrade after two years. 1100 hp just wasn’t going to do it, and you can’t squeeze any more from the old Sakae engine. The Zero was very good at pulling its nose up, and was very light so that the initial climb seemed impressive, but the speed soon levelled off.",
        "Allied planes could run going up (eventually) or diving down.It should have had the Kinsei 62 engine (1550 hp) for the A6M5 upgrade, like the engineers wanted.2) Aileron servo tabsVery important to improve the roll rate at high speeds. The Zero’s ailerons became very stiff at 300mph, barely moveable. Servo tabs increase leverage and will make them usable.",
        "Rolling well makes the plane’s movements less predictable and pilots can respond more quickly.The Zero actually had them in the beginning, but pilots went wild and overstressed the wings doing high-speed roll and tight turns, risking break-up in mid-air. So Horikoshi removed them to get the pilots to slow down.Put them back on. Late-war aces don’t do steep turns, they fly fast, barrel-roll and slide a lot.3) IJAAF Ho-5 cannonThe Navy’s Type 99-1 autocannons had poor firing rate and muzzle velocity.",
        "You had to be close in to hit anything. The Type 99-2 had higher muzzle velocity but worse firing rate, you can shoot further out but tend to miss. You could install a bunch of them and compensate for the firing rate, if the plane could take it, like the Shiden-Kai and the Raiden. But the Zero is just too small. There’s just no room.Meanwhile the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force had a good autocannon of their own, the Ho-5.",
        "Muzzle velocity like a Type 99-2, and firing rate like a machine gun.A couple of hot Ho-5 on a Zero would be just nice. You turn your plane and rip your target at a shocking distance, just when he thinks he’s beyond range.4) A Working RadioTeam tactics are hard to do without a working radio. Actually there was nothing wrong with the radio itself. The engine’s ignition system was interfering with it, every time a spark plug fired.",
        "Somehow it took them almost three years to realize it and shield the radio.So… increased engine power, tabs for better high-speed roll, Army autocannons, and a shielded radio. Not too much ask for, Shirley?Aww, forget the Zero. Put four hot Ho-5 in a Shiden-Kai please."

        "Valve goes for Intel-Nvidia in first batch Steam MachinesThe game company’s PC console will be skipping AMD in favor of Intel CPUs and Titan GPUs in its first batch of devices sent out to beta testers.Valve’s Steam Machines — not to be confused with the third-party Xi3 Piston Steam Box — will be shipping out to 300 lucky beta testers without AMD hardware inside.According to a blog post by Valve, the Steam Machines will come in a variety of configurations depending on the desired price point: i7-4770, i5-4570, and i3 CPUs are available along with GTX780, GTX760, and GTX660 GPUs.Considering that gaming is such a big push for AMD at the moment, and company representatives are highlighting AMD’s strong alliances with developers, it’s interesting that a major player in PC gaming chose to shun the #redteam for the first batch of what’s sure to be a major success in the PC gaming ecosystem.Nvidia has been quoted by PC Magazine saying “It is no secret that we have been working with Valve on their upcoming SteamOS and that we are huge fans of the living room PC concept.”It could very well be that Nvidia is paying handsomely for this privilege of being the sole provider of GPUs, so far, for the Steam’s PC console.But consider what AMD’s Ritche Corpus, the company’s director of software alliances and developer relations, said during #gpu14 in Hawaii: “We are working just as closely with Valve.",
        "I think the difference is one side of that conversation is being more vocal than the other. If you go to Valve right now and ask them which hardware partners are going to be the partner of choice, they won’t pick one or the other. They are going to be agnostic. They mention that it’s an open ecosystem.”As the official release date for the Steam Machines get closer, more details on the hardware loadouts will be available.Valve has yet to release pricing details for the Steam Machines."

Having hearing assessed consistently allows you to monitor your hearing health and intervene early if you experience any changes.",
        "Early intervention can significantly improve treatment and health outcomes.- Rehabilitate: the most common treatment for hearing loss is hearing aids. These highly advanced devices are designed to absorb, amplify, and process sound; providing significant support and increasing a person’s hearing ability.- Communicate: treating hearing loss has countless benefits including enhancing communication.",

        "It is also a permanent condition that cannot be cured and if untreated, it can lead to significant health issues. Additionally, the symptoms it produces can take a toll on daily living by straining communication which is essential to managing personal and professional responsibilities.

        "Video Games, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, nintendo, wii, ds, sony, microsoft, PSN, XBLA, Onlive, Playstation Vita, Wii U,Regular readers will know that from time-to-time we dip our hairy little toes into the world of PC/Mac programs that will think will interest you. Today is one of those days.Manga Studio 5 EX is a digital art/comic creation program from the guys at Smith Micro. This is a feature-rich graphics creation package designed with the digital artist in mind.",
        "As the name suggests this is the fifth update in the increasingly popular series and the ‘EX’ denotes that this is the pro version that adds few extra features to the standard edition. However, as we haven’t used the previous versions we are unable to compare them, rather review Version 5 on its own merits.Upon first opening MS5 EX the interface and layout will feel familiar to anyone who has used Photoshop and very deliberately so, helping with the ease of transition from Adobe’s staple program.",
        "It is not until you scratch the surface, however that you realise that Manga Studio has some very clever little tricks up its sleeve that sets it apart.Let’s start with what the two programs share. All the main Photoshop elements are there such as the ability to create layers of various types and the overall tool set looks the same, at first glance at least. But it is within these tools that MS5 begins to separate itself from Adobe’s product.",
        "For a start there are various brush and pen settings that allow for a more hand-drawn artistic style to take effect. The ability to change the nib on the pen means that you can get a very accurate hand-drawn look to anything you create. It certainly has impressed the artist Kris Hazard from Gobsmack Comics whom I brought in to help me test the product.",
        "“The pen and brush tools allow you a wide variety of hand-drawn techniques that other paint programs simply can’t match.” He said.Another feature that really impressed Kris was the 3D character model (supplied by the program) that you can import into the window, think the wooden artist dummies in digital form. This model can then be posed into any position, using some pre-installed poses as a starting point if you wish.",
        "You can move every part of the character including its fingers into whichever pose you like and then use this as a template for your drawn character. The model also doesn’t allow you to move limbs out of the range of natural motion, meaning your character will always look real. You can even change their body type to make them fatter,thinner, muscular or childlike. If, like me you are a complete novice, you can also use one of the pre-rendered characters (as seen above) as a starting point.",
        "More characters and poses can be purchased in extra packs available on the MS5 website. On top of this you can edit the perspective to get some really nice natural-looking and consistent characters for your artwork. The program also features whole heap of speech bubbles as standard and all of which can be manipulated and individualised. All of this can also be added into pre-rendered 3D backgrounds that can be rotated and adjusted to suit a scene.",
        "Again this is an excellent tool for the amateurs amongst us.Talking of perspective, MS5 comes equipped with a brilliant perspective ruler. This allows you to select a vanishing point, up to 3 points are available on the selection menu but you can add as many as you wish. You draw your your perspective lines and then any line you draw after that automatically snaps to these lines.",
        "Basically allowing you to draw anything and keep a real looking perspective.The standard version of Manga Studio 5 costs $47.99 (£29.11) and when you consider the power of the program you get that is simply an unbelievable price. The ‘EX’ version however will set you back $209.99 (£127.40) which when compared to Photoshop’s average of nearly £600 is amazing.So what do you get extra in the ‘EX’ version that warrants the extra money?",
        "Well it seems that the vast majority of the features from the ‘EX’ version are included in the standard version with the main difference being the comic creation tool. Instead of having a single page to work with you can workon an entire book at a time. Set how many pages you want in your comic and have all of your artwork in the single file. You can even choose if you want certain pages to be double-page spreads.",
        "Once you have set the number of pages you can draw directly onto each page/panel and you can easily browse back and forth through the comic as you work. It makes organising your comic simple and intuitive.Both versions come with full support pen tablets like, FAVO, Bamboo, Intuos, Cintiq or Wacom. With full pressure sensing.",
        "Meaning what you draw on the page is faithfully recreated on the screen.The Manga Studio website contains loads of free online tutorials (here) to help wring every last drop of your creativity onto the page. If you are thinking of moving over from Photoshop but are not yet quite convinced a quick browse of these should convince you.Overall when you look at what you get in either package and the price you pay for them, there is no denying that both Manga Studio 5 & EX are simply stunning.",
        "The tools have been well honed to give you exactly what you need to produce stunning works in a user-friendly and time-effective way. Whether you are a digital artist or a comic creator I would suggest that this is fast becoming an essential tool.Below is a gallery of images followed by the score."

        "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Despite its reputation as one of the noisiest and most difficult places for opposing quarterbacks to play, Tom Brady says he's excited to travel to CenturyLink Field in Seattle for a Week 6 matchup with the Seahawks.\"I think anytime you go on the road, you expect it to be loud,\" the Patriots quarterback told reporters during a Wednesday news conference. \"We practice with that. I know this is a very -- [the stadium] gets some attention around the league for how loud it is.",
        "I'm actually excited to get out there and play in a place I've never played.\"Seattle is one of just two cities that Brady has not played in during his 12-plus seasons in the NFL (San Francisco being the other), and the quarterback admits he's excited to take the field at a new venue.\"Yeah, I think I've always looked forward to doing that,\" Brady said. \"There probably aren't many that I haven't played in at this point. But this will be fun.",
        "It's always nice when you take 53 guys on the road and you say, 'This is all we've got and this is all we need and this is what we have to do.' \"Among the goals for Brady and his offense will be to quiet the crowd, and, as he states, turn the fans against their own team.\"I think that's an exciting part for road teams, is to see if you can get them booing their own players,\" he said.It won't be easy to do, as Seattle boasts one of the top defenses in the league, and, according to head coach Bill Belichick, the loudest stadium.\"We've played in a lot of loud stadiums before, but none louder than Seattle,\" Belichick said.",
        "\"I think they're as loud as anybody. We'll have to do a good job with our communication and just our mental alertness.\"Belichick says his team will \"crank up\" the noise at practice this week in an effort to simulate the game conditions, but ultimately it will come down to execution on Sunday.\"We can crank up the noise here as loud as you want to crank it up, [but] in the end, Sunday we're going to have to go out there and we know we're going to have to deal with it,\" he said.",
        "\"And it's not just offense, it's your punt protection ... on the field goals, it's all those plays.\"Receiver Deion Branch, who played four-plus seasons with the Seahawks, knows what the Patriots will be facing.\"I think everyone knows the atmosphere of that stadium,\" Branch said.",
        "\"Everybody across the league [knows] it's by far the loudest stadium, and it can get louder and things go bad for the offensive side of the ball.\"In order to neutralize the impact of the crowd noise, Branch says, the Patriots must stay focused on what the team can control.\"I think the biggest thing for us is to make sure we go in and stay focused and try to stay on track, and we can try to control that portion of the game,\" Branch continued.",
        "\"We just have to go out there and do our job, and we can kind of silence them a little. Just a little.\"Seahawks rookie quarterback Russell Wilson, who played his final college season at the University of Wisconsin (whose Camp Randall Stadium seats north of 80,000 people), describes the atmosphere in Seattle as unique.\"There is nothing like it,\" Wilson said.",
        "\"I played in a lot of stadiums in college, in front of 100,000 people, and here I'm not sure exactly what it is -- probably 65, 66,000 -- but it's ferocious in that stadium, just how loud it is, and the energy that the 12th Man fans bring in CenturyLink.",
        "Just that energy, that passion that our fans bring, it really heightens our ability to play at an even higher level.\"The veteran Brady says there's nothing better than taking an opposing crowd out of the game with a strong performance, as his team was able to do in Buffalo during Week 4.\"That's the fun part about being on the road. There's nothing better than being on the road, like in Buffalo a few weeks ago, there were more of our fans there at the end than their fans,\" he continued.",
        "\"We've done that in Pittsburgh, we've done that in some very loud environments.\"Last Sunday at Gillette, during the Patriots' Week 5 victory over the Denver Broncos, Brady and his offense spent the majority of the game running an up-tempo, fast-paced attack.",
        "But in Seattle, in front of a spirited crowd and ambient noise, will that approach work?Brady says the offense can play at a number of different tempos, and will focus on what it believes to be the most effective strategy to attack the opposition.\"I think we have several different tempos that we try to play at. Sometimes you go no-huddle; sometimes we have to slow it down,\" he said.",
        "\"It's all really a matter of how the game is going and how we feel is the best way to attack the other team.\"Every week you go in and you have different modes of playing and plays and schemes, and usually by halftime you narrow those down and you have 30, 35 plays left in the game and those are the ones you have to hone in on,\" Brady said.",
        "\"Whatever is working, that's what we're going to try to do.\"Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll, who compared the Patriots' offense to the University of Oregon's (which Carroll faced annually during his tenure as the head coach at USC), says that practicing fast is the goal of his defense's preparation this week.",
        "He also mentioned getting lined up fast and displaying sound technique as integral to slowing down the Patriots' up-tempo pace.\"It's the problem of getting everyone where they have to go and doing the things you have to do. That's the challenge to it,\" he said. \"If we line up, and get our assignments right, and play well techniquewise, we'll have a chance to show you what we're all about. If not, then we'll look like the other teams they're playing and they'll have their way.\""

        "Rowley: Test misappliedA circuit judge has more than doubled the amount that Queen guitarist Brian May can recover after he settled a private nuisance dispute, ruling that the costs judge at first instance had misapplied the new proportionality test.His Honour Judge Dight, sitting with Master Whalan, found that Dr May and his wife, the actress Anita Dobson, should be awarded £75,000 in costs after they accepted £25,000 in settlement.He stressed that the new proportionality test was not “a blunt instrument” a judge could use to make a substantial reduction in the reasonable costs and bring them down to a “rough and ready but proportionate amount”.“The rules, difficult as they may be to apply in practice, require the specific factors in CPR 44.3(5) to be focused on and a determination to be made as to whether there is a reasonable relationship between them.“I doubt that the rules committee intended that a costs judge could or should bypass an item-by-item assessment and simply impose what he or she believed to be a proportionate global figure.“In my judgment, the tests of reasonableness and proportionality are intended to work together, each with their specified role, but with the intention of achieving what is fair having regard to the policy objectives.”Master Rowley initially reduced the £208,000 costs bill to a shade under £100,000 on an item-by-item assessment, and then cut it to £35,000 on the basis of proportionality.Dr May subsequently described the decision as a “mockery of justice”, arguing that “it’s likely to make it almost impossible for the man in the street to fight back for justice against the bullies who trample all over him”.On appeal, the Mays did not challenge the item-by-item rulings but argued that Master Rowley misdirected himself and misapplied the post-2013 proportionality test.HHJ Dight agreed.",
        "“In particular, [Master Rowley] undervalued the sums in dispute, by a considerable margin in county court litigation, and he gave too little weight to the complexity of the litigation. Further, he reduced the costs disproportionately because of early settlement.”The judge noted that there was “very limited authoritative guidance” on interpreting or applying the test, and “such that there is does not all appear to lead in the same direction”.“In my view, the new rules intended a fresh start.",
        "It seems to me that one has to go back to the wording of sub-rule 44.3(5) and reach a judgment as to the amount of costs whose relationship with all the factors identified in that sub-rule is a reasonable one.“Whether the relationship is reasonable is, in my view, a matter of judgment, rather than discretion, and, as I have said above, requires a costs judge to attribute weight, and sometimes no weight, to each of the factors (a) to (e).“Further, it seems to me that the word proportionate is intended to have a consistent interpretation across rule 44.3(2), rule 44.3(5) and 44.4, which means that in considering proportionality, the court is to have regard to all the circumstances (see CPR 44.4) which includes, but is not limited to, the further factors specified in CPR 44.4(3) even though they are not specifically referred to in CPR 44.3.“There is a considerable degree of overlap but the plain intention is that there should be a holistic approach; the costs judge is intended to stand back and look at the overall picture.”HHJ Dight added that whether the relationship between the costs and the relevant factors was reasonable required “an objective assessment and an objective balance to be undertaken in respect of them with a view to achieving the policy objectives of compensating the receiving party for his expenditure but not requiring the paying party to pay more than the litigation warranted”.But he doubted that the proper interpretation of the rules entitled a costs judge at the end of an item-by-item assessment to impose a very substantial reduction on the overall figure without regard to the component parts.“I reiterate that what the rules require the judgment to achieve is a balance, a reasonable relation, a correlation which may necessitate a certain amount of fine tuning.“There may be a limited range of acceptable difference in the total figure once the rules have been applied, in that different judges could legitimately come to slightly different conclusions as to the proportionate sum, and so long as they have applied the rules correctly they should not be open to challenge on appeal.“However, the final figure in this case does not appear to be based on any specific mathematical calculation nor is there a specific explanation of how the weighting of the various factors resulted in the final figure.”"

        "After spending so much time coding the new photo site, I finally deemed it “good enough,” and was ready to venture outside for a long walk around town. I’d suck in a little of that fresh Vancouver air and, if something struck my fancy, I might even take a photo or two. Normally, long walks are an essential part of my work day because, in my estimation, I solve about 90% of my most complicated problems while pounding pavement.",
        "It’s one of my many little idiosyncrasies that makes it essential that I work at home. Whenever I’m given a complex design task by an employer, the first thing I do is take off out the front door. Walking is how I accomplish my best design work. And there’s the rub — admittedly, it doesn’t reflect too well on me if, when presented with a big problem to solve, I’m seen immediately leaving the office for a couple of hours.",
        "Water cooler politics would, of course, dictate that I make a beeline for my desk and sit there shuffling papers with furrowed brow until the task is accomplished. But, for me, the desk is just about the last place where I’m going to be productive… at least when dealing with issues related to design or creativity.So these last few weeks have been an anomaly because I actually have been stuck at my desk. It’s not that web design isn’t creative.",
        "It’s just that, for every 5 minutes I spend designing the site, I have to spend the next 3 days getting cozy with Google — researching all the code, tools, and techniques required to actually implement the thing. I design while walking. I solve problems while walking. But research requires being chained to my desk.After three weeks of research, I was more than ready to walk. Last time I was out, I was kicking through a shin-deep sea of beautiful red maple leaves.",
        "Now I’m kicking through shin-deep snow. Funny how much can change in a few short weeks. Vancouver has recently seen about a foot-and-a-half of snow, and more is falling as I write this. The air is fresh and crisp. The dogs are happy.",
        "The trees are enrobed in a shroud of white where, just last month, they were warm in their brightly saturated red, orange, and yellow jackets.When I captured the image at the top of this page, I was walking south across the Granville Street Bridge, nearly blinded by the bright winter sun, which hung low above the horizon. As I approached a park on the south shore of False Creek, the trees began to filter the harsh winter sun, making it look as if the snow itself was luminescent.",
        "In the distance was a couple walking a dog—muzzle burried in the snow. Regrettably, I needed a long lens, but had the 17-40 wide-angle mounted on my camera. The moment would pass if I switched lenses, so I took the shot with the 17-40; later cropping away at least three-fourths of the captured scene to get the composition I wanted.",
        "Those 21 megapixel images can really help save a shot like this.The extra-blustery winter scene, shown above, was captured with my little Panasonic LX3 on my way to buy ice cream (I kid you not) at Choices Market on Christmas Eve.The “his and hers” scooters, above, caught my eye because the snowmobile was invented in Canada.",
        "Of course, despite all appearances to the contrary, neither of these are representative examples.The snowlady, below, fascinated me not just because she was so well realized, but because she’s so indicative of the city in which I live. She’s standing in a downtown public park. I walked by her in the morning then, again, in the afternoon — yet no one had stolen her purse, her earrings, her beads, her fur color — nothing!."

        "Female eye makeup men - some men do not like make-up?Opinion male stylists and ordinary men about women's makeup is radically different.Stylists believe that the most attractive looks and made up pomaded lady with false eyelashes, red lipstick, rouge and makeup \"Smokey Eyes\".But if we take into account the results of surveys from time to time carry out men's magazines, it turns out that the idea of female beauty in men are quite different.So whether we women chasing fashion, mindlessly follow the advice of stylists and makeup artists spend a lot of money on cosmetics?Or listen to what men say?At least learn the man's opinion will be interesting, and whether to take note of it - it's up to you of course.Thus, the female eye makeup men - do not like men in women's make-up?Men look at women's makeupEyeshadow blue and blueJust such colors recommend makeup artists for an evening make-up club-style \"disco\".But it turns out, men categorically do not accept these colors, calling eyeaggressive colors for makeup «smoky eyes»As it turned out, makeup «smoky eyes» in bright, iridescent colors of men prefer to admire from afar and only on billboards, but not in real life.His chosen one as huge ink circles around the eyes, they do not want to see.Classic smoky «smoky eyes» with black decoration outside corners of the eyes, which are so fond of women, men do not like - the common makeup makes the woman into something mediocre, absurd, standard.Makeup in the style of \"vamp»This makeup does not lend itself masculine understanding - of what a sweet young lady to do something violent, frightening, daubed in black and red?Red lipstick and black eyeliner is good for the theater stage, but what in life look so scary?It is unlikely that such a make-up is able to attract men, rather - and scare off guard.Lipstick bright color, sticky lip gloss, lip linerIn the men's \"black list\" a lot of shades of lipstick, but perhaps the most surprising reaction was the red lipstick.Which only argument against this trend was not made - vulgar, old-fashioned, looks very unfeminine, is associated with the mother, and therefore do not want to kiss, tired scour traces of lipstick from the skin and shirt.We add that it is very fashionable this season neon shades of lipstick, too, did not deserve the favor of men.As well as lip gloss with a sticky consistency and pencils loop from which remains on the lips even when the lipstick was gone.overhead and lush lashesFashion trend make-up in 2012 - false eyelashes.It is a favorite among makeup artists, but a normal part of the male population is not held in high esteem.The most innocuous definition of such a make-up - \"burenkiny eyelashes\" and \"cow look\", and some who speak more radically - \"standard cheap brothel.\"Approximately the same attitude to the natural lashes coated with three layers of mascara.Of course, women can advance your argument - it is not all nature has awarded elegant eyelashes and mascara without makeup is not makeup.Here's what you can do to lashes look natural: use beam eyelashes of different lengths, then the transition from the inner corner of the eye to get a natural appearance.Mascara You may not be necessary.eyebrows \"thread\" and thick eyebrowsMen's nature abhors extremes, and look nice because most girls who have the natural shape of the eyebrows.Men do not understand why you need to pluck her eyebrows, making them thin thread, a pencil and then try to draw that to pull out?Thick, thick eyebrows, too, cause negative feelings - they are good for the image of brutal men, for the image of the man-athlete, but not for girls.«Bust\" with foundation and powderHow joke men - \"trying to hide minor problems, the woman all her face turns into a continuous problem.\"To some extent they are right - is that a layer of foundation and powder so tightly that the face looks like a mask.Better natural paleness and \"native\" pimples than a layer of plaster - this is the opinion of half of mankind.Perfume with a sharp or heavy smellThis is a real headache for men.Feminist aromas with notes of tobacco, leather and other heavy odors annoy them, strong floral aromas and sickly-sweet smell of fruit they do not like, and even perfume should not resemble the one that was used by \"ex\", and yet - like the man himself.In general, if it is difficult to know what smells like your man, you'd better choose the fragrance together.In the \"black list\" were false nails and tanning.About nails already written a lot - this is an attribute of female beauty for men at least a sense of caution, and at best - the desire to cut frightening manicure.As for tanning, the female body unnatural orange, and even with spots, nothing but disgust in men causes.So it is not all that popular with women, will be enjoyed by both men and much of what we consider beautiful, fashionable and stylish men absolutely do not like.\"Tune\" of women, many men simply can not tolerate, an abundance of cosmetics are not welcome, and in general - a man for that makeover was minimal, imperceptible.And if she can afford to do without make-up at all - it's just great!"

However, our 6-week Rock Conservatory program stays true to our studio's roots by keeping our groups small, intimate and hand-matched for the best experience and results.",
        "Held periodically throughout the year, 100% attendance to all shows and rehearsals are mandatory, and parts must be practiced (and preferably memorized) outside of the studio.",
        "All band members must work together as a team to ensure that the outcome is the highest they can achieve.We also strongly stand by the students being as self-sufficient as possible, and adults do NOT play in the bands unless a part cannot be covered by a student.While not necessary, a background in music theory is very helpful in order to execute correct chord, key and tempo changes, and while everyone is welcome, we expect the same growth that we see in our private lessons.",
        "An audition is required for outside students; please call to arrange one. We have many different student groups, organized by skill level.Rock Conservatory coaches are seasoned rock veterans who make their living playing professionally. They have opened for many top 40 bands (including Puddle of Mudd and Dream Theater), taught for premiere rock schools in Westchester, and continue to take part in many exclusive cover bands and original projects.",
        "Check out many photos from student shows over the years.New students, whether beginners or experienced, are always given a free trial lesson with our staff to determine if our studio is the right environment for them. Absolutely everyone is welcome, but we expect students to treat our instructors and their time in our studio seriously. Teacher availability changes depending on where in the teaching semester we are or how many students we have.",
        "If you would like one of our highly recommended teachers for a day or time that is not available, you can join a wait list for desired availability. Please call for rates/availability and check where we are in our semester calendar. We can also point you in the direction of what age is best for what instrument.PRIVATE INSTRUCTIONPrivate lessons are offered on site in 30, 45 and 60 minute durations.",
        "We currently offer:30 minutes is best for beginners, and as students advance (or if they've had prior training), they can increase their lesson time with teacher approval. Lessons are held each week on the same day/time. Students are absolutely required to study written music theory, physical technique, history and practice/performance strategies. We expect students and parents to commit to a healthy attendance schedule, especially if you want to see results.Hubbels Music © 2019"

        "Jan. 30, 2015 For the first time ever, the NFL will air a pitch perfect, poignant PSA by No More.org against domestic violence that resonates on multiple levels and can be used as a tool to uncork important conversations even in the classroom.",
        "Scripted with powerful realism, brilliant visual execution and based on a compilation of authentic 911 calls, this amazing PSA is a powerful outreach tool and icebreaker for topics like teen dating violence, consent, student campus assault, bullying,…especially in a year when the World Health Organization has ranked adolescent health as a priority with a worldwide lens of concern focusing on youth ages 10-19!As with any media literacy narrative, reading between the lines is what it’s all about…listen carefully to what’s being said, and not said.Airing this Sunday with NFL support, it’s a ‘show and tell’ moment conveying the ‘things are not always as they seem’ reality that readily applies to ALL media narratives, showcasing the need to use critical thinking at ALL times and not take ANY situation at face value.(In part one and part two, we discussed how media literacy applies to Super Bowl advertising and social media tactics themselves)Though Super Bowl ads are rife with examples to spring-board out of the shallow end into deeper thinking and murky waters impacting children’s health and wellness, this SPECIFIC public service announcement is a case study in digging beneath the surface to look at the roots rather than the topsoil.",
        "I absolutely love it.How can we use this PSA with teens to instill media literacy?Open-ended student questions specific to this PSA might be:Why do you think this is airing during the Super Bowl?What events precipitated this ad and who is behind it?Who helped fund the PSA and why?",
        "What do you think it cost?Have you ever been in a dangerous situation where you couldn’t speak freely or truthfully?What outcomes do you think this might have among students—players–the Super Bowl audience?What demographics are they trying to reach and do you think they succeeded?What did you learn about content, tonality, and subtext of messages?“When it’s hard to talk, it’s up to us to listen” is the tag line, who is the “us” you think they’re referring to?Who is the “us” in your world with deeper listening skills?",
        "(social media? peers? parents?",
        "teachers?)Domestic violence hashtags include: #NoMore, #DV and #VAWThe ‘pre-game’ lineup of social media buzz is already occurring with the #NoMore hashtag for the PSA adding lift to the #DV (domestic violence) hashtag and #VAW (violence against women) hashtag where conversations primarily reside.There will also be prominent pushback on NFL policies themselves, such as the #GoodellMustGo hashtag by activist UltraViolet calling for the ouster of the NFL commissioner for his lack of enforcement/investigation into pro player’s domestic violence charges and arrests, and cross pollination of their :15 second ad on sites like Sports Illustrated online (SI.com).",
        "Citing Public Policy Polling in “Women Flag NFL For Handling of Abuse” 55% of women do not approve of the way the league handles domestic abuse, while 67% believe the NFL should do more to prevent players and other league personnel from assaulting women.”Students might study the difference between awareness vs action…Super Bowl Ads that persuade for purchases vs purposes…Or even write about the role of advocacy overall as it’s veered into mass media sports events.Students might study the difference between awareness vs action…Super Bowl Ads that persuade for purchases vs purposes…Or even write about the role of advocacy overall as it’s veered into mass media sports events.Using the No More.org domestic violence PSA, students could monitor the ‘number of shares,’ look at traction and action at a higher level of policy, and debate the efficacy of clicktivism…They could follow the money trail of ‘sponsorship’ and watch how pinkwashing controversies of NFL’s Pink October are media manufactured machinations vs sustainable change maneuvers…And track NFL policy and behavioral change to incite accountability.It’s a quick way to teach why turning profiles purple for DV or having football players wearing purple bands may be supportive and social but not necessarily convert to policy and practices.Students could also report on social media’s role in social justice movements and the spillage into sports arenas (like the solidarity of uniforms/basketball jerseys w/Ferguson/I Can’t Breathe) or discuss media fairness and politics of media coverage in general, like Seattle Seahawks Marshawn Lynch’s personal protest, agency vs.",

        "The FCC has fined a Boston radio station $4000 for airing misleading announcements on the radio station as to the nature of the prize to be awarded in a station contest. In addition to an interesting set of facts in this case, the FCC’s decision also reviews several other recent decisions in explaining why it came to the decision it did as to the amount of the proposed fine.In this case, the contest was promoted on the air as an opportunity to win a choice of three cars.",
        "The \"Cool, Hot or Green\" contest announcements never revealed on the air that the winner in fact did not receive the car, but instead only a two year lease on the car, and only if the winner passed a credit check. Nor did the on-air announcements mention that full contest rules were available on the station’s website.",
        "While the written rules on the website made clear that the prize was merely a lease of the car, as has been the case in many recent decisions (see our summaries here and here), the Commission faulted the licensee for not broadcasting an accurate disclosure of these rules on the air.",
        "While the licensee argued that this was but a minor ambiguity in the rules, the FCC, reviewing some recent decisions, disagreed.In reaching this decision, the FCC looked at two recent cases in drawing a distinction between a case that deserved a fine, and one in which only an admonition was appropriate.",
        "The case that drew an admonition was one where a licensee had a contest where parties could try to win prizes during different music segments – telling listeners that they could \"enter as often as you like.\" The complaining party interpreted that to mean that they could enter multiple times during a particular segment, when the station meant that they could play at as many different times as they wanted as long as it was in different segments.",
        "The FCC found this to be merely a matter of interpretation as to the meaning of the promotional phrase, and just admonished the station.That was contrasted to another case that the FCC found to be more similar to the current case. In that case, the licensee announced that it was giving away tickets to the premiere of Spiderman, without disclosing that the tickets did not guarantee that there would be room in the theater for the winner.",
        "When the winner showed up and was denied access to the premier, the station gave him tickets to another movie, and tickets to a later showing of Spiderman. As the station did not deliver what was promised (tickets to the premier) and did not disclose on the air that the \"ticket\" did not guarantee entry to the theater, the FCC fined the station $4000.",
        "The Commission felt that this precedent was more akin to the current case, leading to the fine in today’s decision.What this decision once again shows is the Commission’s insistence on stations providing clear rules for their contests, following those rules, and announcing all the material terms on the air in a clear and unambiguous way.",
        "As the cases make clear, it is difficult to tell whether a misleading contest promotion will lead to a fine or an admonition – neither of which a station wants on its record. If the material rules of a contest (which we summarized here), including the nature of the prize and any material limiting factors on the value or availability of the prize, are not clearly disclosed in on-air announcements, and the FCC gets a complaint, a fine like that imposed here may very well result."

        "A number of food options also are available.Fox and Bussard, both Lansing natives, are passionate about wine and saw an opportunity to create a market for their passion in the heart of the downtown.\"We've been lovers of wine for quite a few years,\" Bussard said. \"We think we can carve a niche. Everyone we've talked to seems really excited that we're doing this.\"Bussard traces his own love of wine back to his second Iraq deployment while serving in the U.S. National Guard.",
        "When he was in Iraq, Bussard read a lot of material about wine and became interested in the history behind the drink.\"I couldn't drink it at the time, so I learned about it,\" he said.Under Huntington National Bank's Small Business Associate's Patriot Express program, Bussard received a $120,000 loan to help get P Squared up and running as he transfers into civilian life, according to a press release from the bank.Bussard and Fox have backgrounds in business and management, so once the idea was tossed around to get a wine bar up and running, it never went away.",

East Jackson lost to Apalachee 1-0 back on Feb. 18.Eagle coach Tedd Sims — whose team was coming off a 7-2 win over Cherokee Bluff Tuesday — called the close loss “a growing process.”“It’s all about a process,” he said.",
        "“Doing the right things every night, playing the game hard every night, and if you get in a buzz saw like this and you come away with a 1-0 loss, you tip your hat to the other team.”The Bears scored the lone run of Wednesday’s game with an RBI single from Jackson Kemp in the top of the sixth inning.Cherokee Bluff starter Dylan Kautz threw five no-hit innings before East Jackson broke-up the no-hit bid in the sixth inning.",
        "Kautz allowed two hits and struck out 10 batters in six innings of work.East Jackson starter Cole Sealey threw six innings, allowing four hits and one unearned run with five strikeouts, but was unable to finish out the game after injuring himself while throwing an off-speed pitch in the seventh inning.“I just know he’s a tough competitor and he’s in a lot of pain,” Sims said.",
        "“It’s tough.”Sealey possibly sustained an elbow injury to his throwing arm, but Sims didn’t want to speculate.“He said it was his elbow, but I don’t want to jump to conclusions,” he said.",
        "“It could just potentially be a pulled muscle and that’s what I’m hoping for.”Freshman Brayden Redding came on in relief of Sealey and threw a perfect seventh inning.“I just told him, you never know when your shot is going to be called, and he went out there and got three-straight outs,” Sims said. “He did a great job.",
        "I’m proud of him.”East Jackson missed its best chance to score in the fourth inning when it put runners on second and third with one out, and then later loaded the bases with two outs, but came away empty.“We didn’t have the timely hit tonight that we had last night against these guys,” Sims said. “Coach (Jeremy) Kemp, he does a good job. We played college ball together, so we know one another very well, and I knew his guys were going to be ready to battle today.",
        "I wouldn’t expect anything less.",
        "We just competed and fought and battled and you tip your hat to them.”Sims reiterated his concern for Sealey after the loss.“Right now, my number one concern is Cole, and (we’ll) just see where we go,” he said.The Eagles host Riverside Military Friday at 6 p.m.•EAST JACKSON 7, CHEROKEE BLUFF 2 (TUESDAY): Prior to losing 1-0 on Wednesday, the Eagles went on the road Tuesday and scored four runs in the third inning and three in the sixth inning to pick up a win over Cherokee Bluff.Halton Hardy threw a complete-game gem, allowing five hits and two runs with 10 strikeouts.",
        "He walked just one batter.The Eagles finished with 14 hits.Cole Sealey went 3-for-4 with a double, triple and an RBI. Jarrett Pursley went 3-for-4 as well with an RBI.

        "Grand Opera brings Scottish director David McVicar's provocative version of Jules Massenet's Manon to the Wortham Center this month for a retelling of the classic bad-girl-gone-good story (or is it good-girl-gone-bad-gone-good?) that is both visually stimulating and a pleasure to the ear. McVicar, whose work is rarely seen in America, adds a modern and refreshing dimension of drama to the production by using dancers and chorus singers as voyeurs to the story.",
        "They lurk behind Rubenesque screens, peer from around mannequins and stare from atop Tanya McCallin's minimalist set. As Manon grieves for her lost love, whom she has cast away for fame and fortune, they applaud her as if to say, \"Oh, what a great performance, you fickle trollop.\" They provide a social context by serving as an audience within the opera.They also do other things, which you wouldn't want small children to see.",
        "There's some definite under-the-skirt fondling going on in one scene; in another, a woman is taking a piss. Then there's the table scene in Act IV, in which a blindfolded wench is seductively led across a gambling table by bound hands before being pushed into the groping arms of spectators. Oh, and there's kissing, real kissing, not the fake opera kind you usually see. Was Atom Egoyan's Salomé as overtly sexual?Still, the gist of the tale is unchanged.",
        "Manon falls in love at first sight, runs away with the lucky guy, then ditches her lover when a better offer comes along, only to go back to him and pry him from the priesthood, almost ruining his life before she is sent to prison, where she dies in his arms. Ain't love grand?So is American soprano Elizabeth Futral, who made her HGO debut last year in Of Mice and Men.",
        "It's hard to tell if her Manon is a flighty girl with fluff for brains or a modern feminist full of hedonism, but the lyrical quality of her voice makes up for the lack of character definition. In the early acts, and there are six of them (it's a long opera, though not by Wagnerian standards), Futral is a charming 16-year-old country girl whose family has sent her to a soldier cousin to be escorted to a convent. She sings in a light, almost childish voice that she was too fond of pleasure.",
        "Yet she doesn't seem wanton. Even as the Chevalier des Grieux professes his instant love for her and begs her to go off with him, she is hesitant. Futral does not show Manon's sensual side until the famous letter duet, in which she drapes herself over a table as her lover reads the missive he will send to his father.American tenor Scott Piper, a last-minute Chevalier des Grieux sub for ailing Marcello Giordani, comes through in the clinch.",
        "In his premiere HGO performance, he's able to match Futral in the love duets; indeed, the two make some beautiful music together. And then there's that kiss, one of the greatest kisses in all opera. As Manon tempts the pious Chevalier back into her web of lust at the seminary of St. Sulpice in Act III, the lovers end their reunion with an embrace and a kiss that sends shivers down the spine. Such passion!",
        "Too bad we know that Manon, like so many opera heroines, is headed for the great beyond.As for the visuals, McCallin's sets are Spartan, but her costume designs are rich and opulent. Paule Constable's effective lighting design makes occasional use of giant stadium lighting behind the bleacher/wall-like set.",
        "French conductor Emmanuel Joel debuts in Houston with a rousing rendition of the Massenet work, and the HGO Orchestra just keeps sounding better with each outing this season.More French (or is that Freedom?) influence comes in the form of Marc Barrard, a baritone also making his HGO debut. As the less-than-trusty soldier Lescaut, he bestows some less-than-cousinly kisses upon Manon and then aids in the lovers' breakup.",
        "He does redeem himself by reuniting Manon and des Grieux in the final scene, but one is never quite sure where his intentions lie. He does, however, have a wonderfully rich voice and a commanding stage presence.Overall, there's great music, a good plot, pretty things to look at -- but let's not talk about the dancing in Act III.",
        "The ballet divertissement is silly; one would expect something a little weightier and more original from Michael Keegan-Dolan, the Irish choreographer who gave us the incredible avant-garde apple scene in Ariodante earlier this year.That aside, this Manon is certainly worth seeing, both for its own sake and for the stimulating after-theater conversation on women, wealth and sex. What do women really want?",
        "Well, maybe we want not to always die in the end, but then, \"C'est la l'histoire de Manon Lescaut.\" And the story of us all.Sponsor Content"

        "ASA took a proactive approachthat prepared us for the patient, public and mediainterest, and ensuing concerns anticipated withthe release of “Awake.” While the moviefizzled, ASA was in a unique position to addresspatient and public concerns about the safety ofanesthesia and what we are doing to decrease therisk of awareness. We produced public service announcementson public television in Washington D.C., as wellas the Colorado market.",
        "A movie advertisement wasplaced in theaters in major cities and was run justbefore the viewing of a movie. This 20-second advertisementdemonstrated the role of the anesthesiologist andstressed that if a patient has questions, he/sheshould contact a reliable source such as ASA’sWeb site. Upon the release of the movie “Awake,”the ASA offices and our membership received manymedia inquiries.",
        "Our membership was well preparedto handle these inquiries because of our distributionof message points and training of members throughour spokesperson training programs.",
        "At least 20members underwent a special spokesperson trainingprogram dedicated to awareness under general anesthesia.In addition, our programs at the ASA Annual Meeting— the Leadership Spokesperson Training Programheld in conjunction with our Legislative Conference,our resident’s workshop, and our regionalspokesperson training programs — have allrecently addressed awareness and placed us in aposition to set up individual physicians in eachstate to become leaders and spokespersons with respectto this “hot topic.” We were able toput these state leaders in touch with their localnewspaper, radio and television journalists.Addressing Future NeedsAll of this effort was expended on just one issue.Some of it was proactive, some was reactive.",
        "ASAis currently considering several consulting firmsto help formulate our messages not only to the targetaudiences of our patients, the public, and legislativeand regulatory officials, but also to our membership.This activity will help us in these and future timesto supply the public with our very positive andvery effective message and leave them with a long-lasting,positive image.

        "SAVE We used to live in a world where guys make the first move, taking in the knight-in-shining-armor role. More often than not, girls play the waiting game, and saying “I like you” before the guy does was considered to be unladylike. But yay! Women are more empowered now, and gone are the days when they wouldn’t say anything and let guys do all the hard work. So girls, if you like someone, tell them how you feel, regardless if you’re the first to make the move.",
        "Bring your A game because here are reasons why you shouldn’t be afraid to do so: 1. It’s the 21st century.We’re already in the modern dating era where being old school isn’t so cool anymore. No matter what the traditions say before, we should always welcome and embrace change. Yay to being progressive! 2. Guys also like the kilig factor from time to time.While guys accept the challenge of being the one to say it first throughout the years, it’s now time for girls to return the favor.",
        "Guys are human beings – they like getting kilig or being flattered, too. 3. A little confidence never hurt anybody.Being confident is one of the most attractive qualities anyone can possess which also makes you feel good about yourself. And telling someone you like him first just means you know in yourself what you’re looking for – the lesser tendency to settle for less. 4.",
        "There are still torpe guys out there.Not all guys are courageous enough and have all the guts to come out and admit their feelings for you. They can be very shy too. Yes, the concept of being torpe still exists today. Taking the initiative may go a long way. 5. Life’s too short to not say how you feel.Don’t waste your time and wait too long before telling him how you feel. Grab the chance while you can and go for it. So what if you’re making the first move? As they say, you only live once.",
        "Yes, dating rules were created before for a reason. But now that we are in a place where we aim to achieve gender equality, it’s time to make some adjustments. So the next time you come across the opportunity of admitting your feelings to the guy you like, don’t be afraid to do so. With the right timing and proper mindset – you definitely got this!

They have let him get away with so many pieces of crap now while sending home designers who suck less. I don't even hate Santino in any personal way--I think he's kind of funny--but his clothes BLOW.I'm the first to admit that Nick's suit for Daniel wasn't so great. His seams weren't smooth (though they did manage to HOLD TOGETHER) and, yeah, the judges were right that the pants should've had pockets.",

And they're giving him a hard time because the jacket didn't include a fastener while Santino's fugly jumpsuit is dropping limbs like it's suffering the final stages of leprosy ON THE RUNWAY? The suit was not that bad, is all I'm saying:But I guess this is the end, Nick.",

Auf Wiedersehen.7 Comments:Oh yes, yes yes, I completely agree with you! Kara is indeed lovely, but NO ONE could be lovely in that ill-made jumpsuit.",
        "The show seems hell-bent on keeping Santino less because of his designing skill (which is servicable, but frankly below the quality of, say, Andre's) and more because he's the most \"outrageous\" personality that this season produced.All I'm saying is that the winner had better be Daniel or Chloe, as they can actually sew and design well ...(oh, and Shelley, it's me: Kathy S. from days gone by in the basement!)The color of the jumpsuit was even ugly! It was an extravaganza of fug!Hi, Kathy!",

There was so much wrong with their decision to vote of Nick. It was a jumpsuit, a freaking jumpsuit. She looked like a brown caterpiller. And so I'm thinking well they're just letting him pass because of his overall performance, but then Robot-girl lets Daniel know that it should have been him to go.",

I just don't get it.I can't watch those reality shows but I have to tell you what that picture reminded me of...remember those old McDonald (I think it was McDonald's) commercials where the woman was dressed in some potato sack dress with a bubushka on her head and they said in some foreign accent, \"Svimvear\", \"Eveningvear\" yet the outfit never changed?! It was that same poopy color, too.from the TWoP recap:\"Here comes Daniel.",

I think he looks like a little Brit rocker right now.\"Thank you! Did I say mod Beatles? By Jove, I believe I did.Daniel is feminine. The suit was supposed to be mod. It was made for the runway; and Daniel rocked that suit all the way down the runway. Do the judges remember the point of the freaking show? The designer's are designing for the runway.",
        "They aren't designing for mainstream America. In this particular episode, they were supposed to design for a specific person. Nick designed for a super thin, angular-faced, could dress up like David Bowie pretty easily dude who doesn't need pockets to walk down the freaking runway.It's so wrong to make an outfit for a man without pockets but it's okay for Santino to make an outfit that screams slutty crack-whore Barbie for Kara?",
        "If I were Kara, I would have said to the judges, \"Excuse me, but I think I am having an allergic reaction to all this glue that is holding this heinous polyester to my body.\"Why didn't the judges ask the designers who had been designed for more questions about the outfits that were made for them? I know they asked some, but they should have asked more.I must admit that Daniel's clothes have impressed me, being the fashion icon that I am, but he seemed a bit petulant last week with some of his answers.",

        "In airplanes the roll is controlled by the ailerons, the pitch is controlled by the elevators, and the yaw is controlled by the rudder.In helicopters the rotating main blades (with an airfoil cross section) take care of roll and pitch, while the yaw is controlled by the tail rotor. For roll and pitch, the blades are turned around their respective longitudinal axes with the help of the swash plate drive.",
        "As a result, the angle of attack of the air changes at the rotating blade, and consequently the lift on the blade is changed. When the swash plate is horizontal, then the lift is equal at every blade. As soon as the swash plate is tilted, the lift on the blades changes and causes a turning moment on the helicopter.The tilt of the lower swash plate is adjusted by the pilot. The rotating swash plate is placed on the lower swash plate on a bearing. The rotating blades are attached to the rotor shaft.",

Your spouse may also be able to get a Veterans Home Loan.Step 5: Find support groups.",

Also, check out our online offerings where the spouse community can offer you tips.The best advice comes from those who have lived through and flourished in this sometimes challenging new position.",

        "We recently took on a music video which required a long take for the opening shot. Our best bet would have been to rent a stabilizer, such as Steady Cam, as well as an operator. This would be ideal so that we could have relied on the expertise of another, allowing us to do our job. However, the budget would not allow for that (typical indie music budget, am I right?!).",
        "We then looked at renting a DJI Ronin, which we knew was a more accessibly priced option, but were unfamiliar with the quality of the product. After comparing the rental rates with the actual cost of the item (about 20% of the retail price), we hesitantly made the jump to purchase the Ronin.",
        "For a small company such as ours, any substantial purchase such as this must be weighed with these considerations:-Will this make our product substantially better?-Will it pay for itself, or better yet, return a profit?-Will it help us be more efficient, or slow down productivity (affecting profit)?-Is this item something we can use in a variety of productions (or is it too niche)?-Can we rent this item out when not in use?-Will it add credibility, add status (perceived value)?Assuming the Ronin works well, it seems to answer those questions positively.",
        "So with that we pulled the trigger and made the purchase. The most intimidating aspect of this was that the Ronin arrived on Friday. The shoot was scheduled for Monday. So I only had two full days to become acquainted with the Ronin. For someone with zero experience operating any kind of stabilizer it was definitely a gamble.Saturday, I decided to spend a few hours setting it up, troubleshooting and getting familiar with it.",
        "Setting it up was fairly self explanatory and within about 30 minutes it was all assembled with the camera on it. Getting the camera to balance was fairly simple, however looking back, there were some things I didn’t understand just yet. I think that is something favorable with the Ronin. You can get it going rather quickly to an acceptable use, however, the more you use it, the better you can operate it.There is an app to control and fine tune the controls which is a big help.",
        "One problem I didn’t realize right away though is that once you’ve used the app, it’s best to turn it off. That way it isn’t continuously trying to tweak the gimbal. Once you get it set, it’s best to roll with it and start shooting. I spent a good hour or so with the app and that was concerning. I didn’t want to have to spend that much time on set fiddling with it while everyone was waiting.",
        "Once I got it seemingly set, then I did my first test shots.The test shots were essentially me chasing family members around the house. Definitely was encouraged by the “out of the box” results. Spent about 2 hours overall on Saturday getting it up and running, including test shots.On Sunday I decided to start from scratch to see if there would be any kinks. I realized with a shorter lens (50mm) that it was having problems. I switched back to the 24-70 lens previously used and it was fine.",
        "This limited my confidence for the next day’s shoot, which allowed me to mentally plan on only using the 24-70. The wider lens is better for this type of thing in my opinion anyway. Set a deeper focus and shoot at 24-28 focal length. That was the game plan. It felt good and we were all set for Mondays shoot.On set, it was smooth sailing.",
        "All the prep work paid off and we didn’t experience any kinks along the way.In addition to the DJI Ronin, we used the Small HD 7” monitor attached to the top cross bar. Otherwise, it’s impossible to see what your shooting. Ideally, someone else would have a wireless follow focus system. But we have yet to incorporate that into the configuration with the Ronin. With that addition, it really seems that this piece of gear could be used on so many things.Overall, we’re very pleased.",
        "If you’re looking to add some sweet tracking shots to your production, hit us up. We will rent the DJI Ronin to anyone in the Philadelphia, New Jersey, Delaware, New York area. We would recommend sending out an operator with it as it protects our equipment, but also frees you up to not worry about the technical considerations with it.Here are some of the first test shots we got with the Ronin:"

        "Recipe: Croque MonsieurA Croque Monsieur is a hot ham and cheese grilled sandwich. It’s a popular French bistro or café sandwich. The name means \"crispy mister\"... the origin of the name is unknown. The original Croque Monsieur was simply just a grilled ham and cheese sandwich using emmentaler or gruyere cheese.",
        "Numerous more involved variations have developed… this recipe is among them.The recipe I have grills the sandwich… then adds a thick Mornay sauce (béchamel sauce with gruyere cheese)on top…sprinkled with some more grated cheese then set under a broiler to melt the top cheese and brown slightly.… this version is absolutely delicious!",
        "recipe makes for a very thick sauce… which is desirable… you essentially spread it on the top of the grilled sandwich before broiling it… if you make Mornay sauce for any other purpose… it would be a somewhat thinner sauce.This recipe makes 4 sandwiches.I hope you try this version of a Croque Monsieur..PRINT RECIPERecipe: Croque MonsieurAll you need:For the Mornay Sauce:2 tablespoons unsalted butter2 tablespoons flour2 cups milk½ cup Sargento Artisan Blend Shredded Swiss and Gruyere Cheese½ cup grated Parmesan cheeseSalt to tastePepper to tastePinch of nutmegFor the Sandwich:8 slices of bread (I use white sandwich bread)About 2 tablespoons of butter or margarine (for spreading)½ lb.",
        "baked deli hamAbout 3 cups of shredded Gruyere and Swiss blended cheeseDijon mustardAll you need to do:To make the sauce:In a small saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter.Add the 2 tablespoons of flour and stir well.Cook for about 2 minutes to “cook off” the flour taste.Slowly pour the milk into the saucepan, whisking constantly with a whisk.Whisk vigorously to make sure there are no lumps.",
        "Sauce will thicken fairly quickly.Remove from the heat and add the shredded cheese, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Stir well until cheese is melted… about 2 minutes. Sauce will be very thick..Preheat the oven to broil.Place grilled sandwiches on a baking sheet.Put a generous helping on of Mornay sauce on the top of each sandwich and spread over the top.Sprinkle about ¼ cup shredded cheese on top of the sauce.Broil sandwiches until the top has slightly browned and started to bubble.",
        "Remove immediately.Watch carefully because once the sauce and cheese starts to turn brown… it will quickly burn if you don’t take it out of the oven immediately.Serve hot.4 comments:I grew up eating Crocque Monsieurs, and Croque Madames too for that matter. Our variation would be to put a slice of tomato between the ham and cheese (Monsieur) or a slice of (canned) pineapple (madame). The cheese we laid down was usually a slice of Gruyere or other swiss cheese rather than the grated kind.",
        "if you have a sandwich maker, It makes a delicious crispy lunch!ikkeMy mouth is watering for this! It sounds soooooo good!Sounds delicious ikke!Oh Katy... it is delicious and not hard to make either!"

        "Just recently, I got caught out by a closure. A closure is a piece of code that can be ‘executed later’, while still retaining the environment in which it was created. A lot of developers mistakenly think anonymous delegates, like lambda expressions, are by definition closures. They can be, but don’t have to (and usually aren’t).I’ll illustrate with the actual code snippet that caught me out.",
        "Unfortunately, at my current client, I can’t make use of the excellent Visual Studio add-in ReSharper, which would have alerted me on this with a “Access to modified closure” warning.foreach (string keyword in keywords) { ToolStripMenuItem keywordTsmi = new ToolStripMenuItem(text: keyword, image: null, onClick: (sender, e) => Clipboard.SetText(keyword)); keywordsTsmi.DropDownItems.Add(keywordTsmi); }In this bit, I am filling up a context menu with new sub menu items, containing keywords that are copied to the clipboard when clicked on.Obviously, this compiles just fine, and the submenu is correctly filled with all the distinct keywords.",
        "However, no matter which keyword you click, it would always copy the last keyword in the list. With this functionality being not-very-much-in-your-face, it slipped through (user) testing.",
        "I’ll be the first to admit we need more unit tests 😉The solution is dead-simple:foreach (string keyword in keywords) { var keyw = keyword; ToolStripMenuItem keywordTsmi = new ToolStripMenuItem(text: keyw, image: null, onClick: (sender, e) => Clipboard.SetText(keyw)); keywordsTsmi.DropDownItems.Add(keywordTsmi); }By assigning the value to a local-scope variable, the compiler will save a separate reference for each keyword, instead of only one that gets modified with each loop (hence the ReSharper warning).",
        "Because the latter is simply the standard behaviour when you use a delegate with a variable like that."

        "The Minnesota Wild have a winger. The winger is big, skilled, leads the team in points, leads the team in goals, drives puck possession and does all that against solid opposition.The problem is that the winger is Dany Heatley.Heatley was acquired from the San Jose Sharks in the offseason specifically to revert to his 40-goal form and lead a postseason run; instead, the Minnesota Wild, after a hot start had them atop the Western Conference as late as Dec.",
        "18, have crashed and burned out of the postseason picture.Heatley, 31, arrived in Minnesota via a one-for-one July trade with the Sharks that sent winger Martin Havlat to San Jose.",
        "Coming off a 26-goal second season for the Sharks that ended with a loss in the Western Conference finals, Heatley was determined to more resemble the guy that had back to-back 50-goal seasons for the Ottawa Senators in 2005-06 and 2006-07.Heatley, who was born in Germany while his father played professionally there and holds dual Canadian and German citizenship, expected it.",
        "The Wild expected it.\"As a goal scorer and a player, you want to be that guy,\" Heatley told reporters after the trade.In 2010-11, he struggled with several injuries and stayed in the lineup for more than a month with a broken hand.\"Last year wasn't the greatest year for me personally, but I'm looking forward to getting back there,\" Heatley said.Wild GM Chuck Fletcher acquired Heatley, along with winger Devin Setoguchi in a separate trade with San Jose, to pump up an offense that, in 2010-11, simply didn't get the puck on net enough—they ranked last in the NHL in shots (26.2 per game) and 26th in goals (2.48 per game).\"Our lack of goal-scoring is well documented.",
        "Our inability to shoot the puck is well documented,\" Fletcher said after the trade. \"We've acquired two players who are able to complement the players on our team real well.\"While Heatley hasn't been bad—again, 20-goal forwards with his peripheral stats don't exactly grow on trees—he simply hasn't done what Fletcher openly believed he would.Minnesota remains, to its detriment, a low shot-volume team, and its success at the beginning of the season has been increasingly exposed as a mirage.",
        "Statistically oriented observers called it out, based on the fact that teams that shoot as little as the Wild do not score enough goals to win enough games to truly contend.When Heatley scored his 20th goal of the season on March 1, the Wild were in their customary position: last in goal-scoring and last in shots per game. It wasn't until three weeks later that Heatley netted his 21st goal of the season, on Thursday against Calgary.",
        "Three weeks later, not much has changed; Minnesota remains the league's worst offensive team, though center Mikko Koivu's pending return should help matters.The issue is a familiar one for anyone who has tracked Heatley's career: How much personal blame does he bear for his team's failings? In the past, that question has taken a different form—with the Sharks and Senators, Heatley was, in some respects, expected to win titles.",
        "With the Wild, the expectation was that he'd help them make the postseason for the first time since 2008. And despite the volatile nature of the Western Conference playoff picture, that's not going to happen in 2012.Heatley's individual lack of production this season lies mainly in a low shooting percentage. His 9.5 mark represents a career low and the continuation of a downward trend that began in 2007-08 with the Senators, when his percentage went from a career-high 18.3 to 15.1.",
        "At that point, the drop was on: He went from 15.1 to, in his first season with San Jose after demanding a trade, 13.9.",
        "Then he went from 13.9 to 12.0 in 2010-11.The Wild, though, are playing Heatley against significantly more difficult even-strength competition than he'd faced with the Sharks, who used other forwards, like Joe Pavelski and Logan Couture, against better opponents.Using behindthenet.ca's Corsi QualComp stat, which measures shots (including those blocked and missed) directed at the attacking net, subtracted by all those attempted on the defensive net, Heatley has faced the second-most difficult even-strength competition among Minnesota's forwards and 10th-most difficult competition of all NHL forwards with at least 50 or more games played in 2011-12.In his last season with the Sharks, Heatley's QualComp ranking: sixth among San Jose's forwards and 280th overall.",
        "Given that, and the fact that he generates more shots than any other member of the Wild, he remains an objectively useful player and has, in a few ways, been better this season than last.That's still a departure from Heatley's stated goal in the fall, when he was open about his desire to show that he was still capable of scoring at an elite level and, implicitly, earning his elite paycheck; his $7.5 million cap hit, which runs through the 2013-14 season, is tied with four others for the seventh-largest in the NHL.\"I hate talking like that, like, 'I'm so motivated,'\" Heatley told the Minneapolis Star Tribune in early October.",
        "\"You ever watch (HBO's) '24/7' where the boxer's like, 'I'm so motivated, I'm in the best shape of my life?' and then the champ knocks him out in the first round?\"\"But yeah, inside me, there's definitely that. You want to prove to everybody, and to your new teammates, and to your new city and fans, that you're the same player you always were.\"For the Wild, the question is whether the player he's become, and the player they've put him in position to be, is enough."

        "It has become common practice to not register as a lobbyist, even though you are one. With unenforced federal law, SEIU president Andy Stern was the most frequent visitor to the White House in 2010. He did not register as a lobbyist. If you are a registered lobbyist, you can donate the max through your spouse.",
        "This is an enormous advantage, as Obama can now ban lobbyists that might conflict with his favored interests.The Obama White administration also hides their meetings with Lobbyists, by meeting outside the White House or other government facilities.

        "Bell’s Own Data Shatters P2P Red HerringAbout a week ago, the CRTC demanded that Bell release to the public by June 23rd information that would prove it’s claim that P2P throttling was having a negative impact on it’s network. Some, but not all, of that information has been made public. Many details are being kept from public view for ‘competitive’ reasons.",
        "Even the scant evidence released shows exactly how flimsy Bell’s case is.One would assume that the company would release the most damaging evidence, but their claim is that over a 2 month period, 2-5% of their network links suffered some sort of congestion. They do NOT say whether that was a sustained range of fluctuation, or brief bursts of congestion.",
        "They then pull out the old “it’s like a highway” canard.In revealing the details, Bell explained in an accompanying letter, the company said, because the situation is similar to the road system — where if one major artery is backed up, all connected roads will also have problems.“Just like a single traffic roadblock can hinder drivers going to multiple destinations that pass through the road that is blocked, a very small amount of congested links can seriously affect a large number of high-speed end-users’ traffic,” Bell said.…as quoted from a CBC article.",
        "On a simplistic level, the ‘highway’ analogy can be helpful to the ‘lay person’, but in this case it’s shorthand for company spin that obfuscates HOW traffic works.Since Bell has no interest in actually enlightening their customers, I’m going to take a moment to show why the analogy falls apart:1) Data packets are the cars of the ‘highway’. They travel at 1000s of kilometres per second.",
        "If they didn’t, a person in Toronto wouldn’t get an email from his friend in Australia a second after the Australian hit send. It would be impossible for someone in Toronto to play a decent game of Call Of Duty 4 with someone from London England. Somehow people are doing it every day.2) the ‘internet highway’ can re-route you in an instant if there’s congestion.",
        "Imagine if the 401 HWY is blocked up, and magically, a second highway appears before you, with no cars on it, and your car is automatically sent onto the new route. The ‘congestion’ Bell claims is more of a dead seagull at the side of the road than a 15 car pile-up (even if it was sustained congestion over that two month period – which they haven’t made explicit).3) Bell is claiming that torrent traffic is the equivalent of a convoy of 18-wheelers blocking the poor little guy.",
        "As we previously reported the numbers show that gaming, web streaming, and email each hog more lanes than all torrents combined.",
        "These numbers come from Ellacoya (now a part of Arbor Networks), a traffic shaping company that Bell is invested in.All of this, when combined with Bell’s congestion claims, should completely dis-spell the myth that P2P is crushing the internet.The throttling issue isn’t the only thing we’ve been facing lately, with the Bill C-61 amendments to the Copyright Act having been tabled, and possibly becoming official after the summer recess.",
        "At least we have all summer to mount an opposition to said bill (I know I’m assuming everyone is opposed to it – after all I don’t think the RIAA or MPAA are reading this).",
        "That’s a whole other article though, and I’d respectfully point you to Michael Geist’s site, as he’s been doing some amazing coverage on the issue.Tags: Bell, CRTC, online rights, TeksavvyPingback: My Thoughts On Bell’s Traffic Shaping Documentation [UPDATED] « The IT Nerd()Pingback: Dilithium()Pingback: Usage-based billing okayed by CRTC()Pingback: rgbFilter » Netflix dominates Canadian bandwidth usage but that’s okay()Pingback: rgbFilter » Usage based billing debates are wrong… and here’s why()"

Be sure to tell us on the phone if you have a spinet or a full sized upright.To make the repair with the sleeves, remove the hammer butt and broken piece. Disconnect the bridle strap and remove the screw in the hammer butt.",
        "I hope you have one of those screw drivers that grabs the screw in the slot. If you drop the screw inside the action, fish it out with a pickle grabber or a magnet.If the shank is broken in the middle, you can use the brass or split sleeves. Trim the ends of the breaks a little bit so that they will fit together without elongating the shank once it is repaired, but do not shorten the overall length of the shank by whittling too much. Make sure the ends mess well before making the glued repair step.",
        "Slide the sleeve down over the end of the shank with some Elmer's carpenter's glue in it. Push the other shank broken end down into the sleeve until the broken ends meet and mess well. Lay it down to dry well before installing it in the action.If you use the brass sleeves, which seem to do a better job, you may find that the sleeve is slightly small than the shank.",
        "In this case, scrape the ends of the break with a sharp knife until the ends are slightly smaller and will receive the sleeve snugly.If the break is near the hammer butt or the hammer head, you must replace the shank.For this job you will need a new hammer shank from my Catalogue, or from your piano tuner. In the tool department you will need a drill bit, which you can purchase from me. You may also have the size in your tool kit.",
        "DO NOT bring a high speed electric drill around anywhere near this job.Here is the procedure:1. Cut off the shank with a knife so that the shank end is flush with the body of the hammer butt, and do the same with the hammer head. Use some pointed tool to make a dimple in the shank bit in the butt and hammer head precisely in the center of the embedded piece or shank. Find a drill exactly the size of the shank piece you removed, and carefully drill out the shank piece.",
        "The hole in the hammer butt should be no more than three eighths of an inch deep. You can buy a hand held drill for this purpose at our Tool Parts Page in the Online Catalog. If you have a battery operated electric drill that does not have much power and can run real slow, you can use that. Otherwise, just hold the drill in your fingers, and suffer a little.If the hammer was set at an angle on the shank, you must again drill the shank piece out at the same angle.",
        "In drilling the hole in the hammer head, try not to go all the way through the hammer head. We sell a jig for drilling out the hammers and butts in the Online Catalog. If you will be doing many of these tasks, you should invest in the jig.2. Remove a good hammer from the piano. This one will be your pattern. Be careful as you push the jacks to one side to get at the screws. Don't push the jacks too far.",
        "Cut a shank, which you ordered from us, so that it will fit into the holes in the butt and hammer head and be the right length. This can be determined by laying the good hammer down and arranging the pieces of the hammer, butt, and shank being repaired next to it. Cut the shank accordingly. Is your repaired one too long? If so, take the hammer off, and carve off a bit of the shank.Here is a graphic showing how to do the above task.Next, fit the shank into the hammer butt hole without glue.",
        "Is it true or straight up and down with the hammer butt? If not, use the drill to ream out the hole so that the shank can be made to come straight out of the hole. After doing this, the shank will be quite loose, but it's not the end of the world.With Elmer's glue, insert the shank into the hammer butt and hammer head, and immediately adjust the thing so that it will lay flat and look just like the good sample hammer.",
        "Lay the repaired on on its side on a flat surface so that it is the same as the sample, and let it completely dry for eight hours before installing it.Put the hammers back into the action. If the repaired hammer is twisted of bent looking, you will need to bend it as in Chapter Six, sub-topic, H. Straighten a crooked hammer.",
        "You may also have to adjust the capstan on the back end of the key lever to bring the hammer to rest on the backrest properlyA grand piano can be repaired with a sleeve, but I always use the split sleeve since the brass one will not fit well. Almost all grand shanks are six sided, so the split sleeve seems to hold better.",
        "Still, you need to glue it all together.You can order new Grand Piano Shanks and flangesfrom our Online Catalog.Suppose you do not have a brass sleeve, and this is an emergency, such as the cantata is tonight. You can still make the repair.Lay the hammer pieces on a flat surface with the ends of the break meshed together WITHOUT glue. Make sure the shank is straight in all directions by supporting the middle where the break is.",
        "When you are sure of your arrangements, glue the ends of the break together with the wood glue. Lay the assembly back down straight, and let the hammer dry for at least four hours.Next, carefully pick up the hammer, and wind cotton thread around the break area, covering the whole break with several passes of thread. Dampen the thread with the wood glue, and smear on a layer over the whole repair when you are done. I have seen this kind of repair still holding that had to be 50 years old.",
        "Aren't you a genius?The best thread for this task would be the kind used to wind fishing rods. This is found at almost any sports and fishing shop. Tell the owner that you are winding a rod that is only six inches long. He will think you are going ice fishing for minnows :-)"

It was tough and it was at times frustrating, but I'm pretty proud of myself for getting in pretty much all of the workouts that I had planned for myself. This self-coaching business is taking a lot of getting used to and I definitely had many periods over the last week of doubt and worry about my fitness level and about whether I will be \"ready\" to race in a few weeks. But consistent workouts and following the plan are helping to boost my confidence.",
        "Add in a few workouts with some good friends and the fun factor was covered off as well!Monday: Run - 8k. I tricked myself into a longer run by purposely heading in the opposite direction of my house after work (I'm still run commuting for now, though revisiting whether I will continue much longer). Normally, I pass by our house about 3.5k in if I head toward home, and it can be very tempting to just go into the house.",

I pulled myself out of bed for my morning swim with ROCS and was glad that I did.",
        "While I am definitely far off the times that I need to be hitting, they seemed a little bit closer at this workout.Saturday: Trail run - 8k. Jenn and I took to the Wolf Trail for a \"hard effort\" run. We had contemplated signing up for a local 10k trail race, but in the end decided to do it on our own. Man, trail running is hard. Running hard is also hard. My body was in utter shock after the lack of hard effort training lately.",

The second half of the trail slowed us down quite a bit, as it was steeper, muddier, and rockier on the descent. We finished off with a little dip (toes only for me) in Meech Lake, which is definitely not warm enough yet for swimming! It was like an ice bath, though it felt amazing after a hard run in (finally) warm temperatures.Sunday: Bike - 64k.",

At times it felt like we might be blown sideways off our bikes, and then at other times it felt like we weren't actually moving forward. We stopped for a nice snack at Alice's Cafe (a great reward for the windy ride), then turned around to head home. It was mostly smooth sailing on the way back and we completed the distance in about half the time!",
        "Always nice to have good company when the riding is tough!A few things that resonated with me this week:On resilience: \"Emotion into Execution: My Path to Resilience\" by Loren RowneyOn running: \"Why I Run\" by Nick TrioloOn owning your strengths: \"Stop Using Qualifiers\" by Carrie CheadleI read EVERY ONE of your posts, so I'll help keep you accountable ;) You are off to a great start with the self coaching!

        "Hey, I'm JP, one of the new guys on Smark Henry. I will be responsible in delivering to you recaps, as well as my thoughts, on the most recent Impact Wrestling episode.But first, a brief background about me and Impact. I have been following pro wrestling since I was a kid, back when it was shown late at night every Wednesday, then later every Saturday in another station. This was before cable TV, so this goes a long way back.",
        "Proof of this is that I was able to watch WrestleMania VI on free TV (back then, spoilers were not a thing, so it is all right if PPV events were aired on tape delay), and the first thing me and my school busmates talked about the following morning was the classic Hulk Hogan versus Ultimate Warrior match.As for Impact, let us fast forward to the 2000s. WWE's contract on pay TV ended.",
        "What took over the timeslot was this upstart promotion called Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, or TNA for short, and its unique six-sided ring. I was in this pro wrestling hiatus during that period, so it took me some time to get acclimated with this new product.Getting to follow the show more regularly, I got introduced to characters like AJ Styles, Shark Boy, Samoa Joe, Abyss, and Jay Lethal.",
        "Aside from promotion owner Jeff Jarrett, familiar faces littered the roster such as Kurt Angle, Christian Cage, Dusty Rhodes, and Team 3D. They made the transition easier for me.And then, our cable TV provider had a channel lineup reshuffle and the next time I encountered TNA was when I actively looked for it. It was a new decade and the promotion was a lot different from the last time saw it.",
        "Eric Bischoff, along with a geriatric Hulk Hogan, was at the helm in both shoot and kayfabe capacities, while an out-of-place Dixie Carter as the smarmy on-screen authority figure was the subject of most major storylines, echoing what the WWE has been doing since Vince McMahon the chairman became a character. Add to that, the six-sided ring was replaced by a traditional four-sided squared circle.",
        "It was a period in the promotion's history that I dubbed \"WCW lite.\" I say that with a lot of derision.All the good juju it accumulated the previous decade quickly eroded as TNA underwent numerous management and roster changes with reports that the promotion is in the red. Then came the Broken Hardys in 2016, and a for a brief moment, all was right in their part of the world.",
        "However, this was not sustained as another set of ownership issues rocked the boat.This is what most wrestling fans' impression of Impact Wrestling was before this year: a mess of a promotion with an identity crisis (it rebranded/renamed thrice in 2017). But with 2018 turning into a good year for pro wrestling in general, the promotion made sure it was not left behind.",
        "With Don Callis and Scott D'Amore taking over, they managed to turn the promotion around to what it is today, picking up the pieces to hopefully once again reclaim the tag as the premier alternative to mainstream sports entertainment.With the history lesson done, let us get down to work.Major ImpactsImpact's main storylines took a backseat as the episode highlighted the debuts of Rich Swann and stable Desi Hit Squad. Swann made his entrance with a theme that has elements of his WWE theme.",
        "He also pulled off his trademark moves and taunts, reintroducing himself to the audience that missed his presence for more than half a year.Curiously, the Cult of Lee was just a cult of one as Trevor Lee made the trip Toronto by his lonesome self.",
        "With no ringside distractions, Swann was able to score a win, although his Phoenix Splash from the second rope looked botch-y as he landed on Lee's knees instead of his torso.Meanwhile, the Punjab-based team led by Gama Singh had to use every heel trick on the book to outsmart Z&E, who just last week lost the Impact tag belts to LAX and now relegated to a gatekeeper role.",
        "Sure, the Desi Hit Squad had to win via dirty finish to establish the fact that they are heels, but that they had to work hard for their first win might have made them unintentionally look weak.After showing highlights of Ohio Versus Everything assaulting and unmasking Pentagón Jr in California, the former Impact champion from Mexico challenged Sami Callihan to a mask versus hair match, to which the latter accepted.",
        "With this development, I guess Callihan's feud with Eddie Edwards is now heading towards another direction (we will get there later).To keep Madison Rayne and Su Yung busy before their bout for the Knockouts championship at Slammiversary, Tessa Blanchard inserted herself in Rayne's promo at the start of the show to set up a main event match between the two.",
        "The match felt dragging, which is compounded by Blanchard's deliberate pace, a contrast to the more athletic and acrobatic matches in the card.After Rayne secured the W with a crucifix, Blanchard, and later Su Yung and her undead bridesmaids, made a go on the victor.",
        "Out came Allie with the save, and now, we have a ready-made angle that can be stretched for the remaining weeks prior to Slammiversary.Also announced during the show that there will be a four-way match involving Johnny Impact, Taiji Ishimori, Fénix, and Rich Swann slated at Impact's next big event. Color me interested.Other Impactful Moments- It is now official. Eddie Edwards has fully turned, attacking Tommy Dreamer during a show in Philadelphia.",
        "We have to thank Callihan for this, as he served as the catalyst for dark Edwards, passing on his mayhem to the former Wolves member like a virus.- The Moose video package is the Bobby Lashley \"sisters\" promo done right. There, I said it.- These LAX segments have proven to be a show of their own.Not-so-Deep Impact Moments- Taped boos during Austin Aries' interview.",
        "What was that for?- Am I the only one who finds it weird that Josh Matthews has forgotten that he served as Matt Sydal's guru just a few months ago?Collating everything, Impact had better episodes this year. But comparing to their output from years back, this is a marked improvement.",
        "As this would serve as the barometer of my future reviews, I would give this one a middle-of-the-road B-.What to expect next week:- Fénix vs Rich Swann- Brian Cage vs Kongo Kong- Killer Kross's in-ring debut- Katarina in a match- Tommy Dreamer addresses Eddie Edwards's attack*****."

        "You’re at a job interview and the questions are starting to make you feel a little uncomfortable. While you are desperately trying to paint a positive picture of your work experience, the employer keeps asking questions about your reasons for leaving, conflicts, and any other negative topic that occurs to him. How can you handle this interview without making a mistake? Here are some tips:Don’t evade the questions.",
        "The employer may be probing you in this way because for some reason, they feel like you are hiding something. If you are evasive when answering their questions, you will confirm their concerns. Make sure that you answer their questions directly, but in a way that serves your own interests.Don’t pretend to be perfect. Nobody’s perfect and if you present yourself as if you are, the employer won’t buy it.",
        "You can admit that you’ve made mistakes, but show that you’ve learned from them and that you always maintain your professionalism.Re-frame negative situations into positive ones. Although this is the oldest trick in the book, it is still the best way to handle negative questions. Focus on the positive points of the situation. How did it make you better at your job? What good things came from it?",
        "For example, you could say that you took on a difficult project that had a negative outcome, but that during the project you met someone who has become a mentor throughout your career. Remember, nobody’s career is flawless; they just want to see that you are a positive person with a good attitude.Don’t discuss any personal conflicts or issues. Personal conflicts make you look petty. It is impossible to sound professional when you are talking about an argument that you had with your co-worker.",
        "If you must mention a disagreement, explain that you both behaved professionally, that you have a high level of respect for each other, and that you came to a consensus in the end.Don’t reveal weaknesses that are strongly related to the job. While you’re not trying to show that you’re perfect, you are trying to demonstrate that you are perfectly qualified for the position. Don’t reveal anything that will cause the employer to doubt your ability to do the job.",
        "For example, if you are applying for a management position, don’t mention any potential issues with regards to your leadership ability.Avoid discussing anything that makes you upset. We all have situations in our past that still upset us. The job interview is not the place to discuss them. When talking about something that makes us upset, we show emotion, and we’re more likely to speak without thinking, which can get you into trouble.",
        "If the interviewer asks you for an example of a challenging work situation that you faced, choose one that is not emotionally charged.Smile and stay relaxed. Negative questions at job interviews can be stressful, but it is important that you don’t let it get to you. Make an effort to stay relaxed and keep smiling. Remember, they are asking all of the interview candidates the same questions, and everyone finds them difficult.",
        "If you can handle these tough questions with grace, you’ll stand out in the crowd.When the employer seems to be completely focused on everything that is negative, it can leave you wondering if you even want to work there! Don’t take it so seriously. Remember that the employer is under a lot of pressure to hire the right person, and it can be very difficult for them to detect someone’s true personality at an interview.",

Well color is one of my favorite tools when designing homes for women with arthritis but if it’s used incorrectly it can be as much hindrance as help. There are thousands upon thousands of paint colors which can be both a blessing and a curse.Arthritis is a heat generating illness. When choosing paint for your home, you want pale, cool and slightly muted colors.",
        "Keep color contrasts to a minimum and remember to consider trims and wood finishes in your overall color schemes.Use flat finishes in your living room, dining room, entry and bedrooms; velvet or eggshell in the kitchen and bathrooms (these soft, semi washable finishes are appropriate for most surfaces), satin which is washable and stain resistant, is good for high traffic areas like hallways and kids’ rooms, and semi-gloss on doors, trim, molding and cabinetry.",

        "I prefer their top of line, Accolades formula.Some paint companies change, discontinue and add to their formulas so whatever company you go with, always ask for their current, premium paint formulation. Be willing to pay the extra money for it and it will not only look stunningly beautiful, it also won’t need to be repainted for at least ten years. My Pratt and Lambert paints at last count are eight years old and I still sigh when I walk in my home.",

It is quite frankly the most beautiful creamy white I’ve ever come across. How often do you actually notice white? Well this one is impossible to ignore.How to Test PaintBuy a small amount and paint it on two 8 x 10 pieces of paperboard. Test the color by holding the papers up or taping them close together, wrapped around a corner, opposite the windows.",
        "Test in multiple spots during different times of the day. Look at them against plain white paper, and look at many different, yet similar colors side by side to get an accurate idea about each color.Choosing Trims and CeilingsThis next part is a bit more advanced than what we’ve been talking about so far. If you have crown molding, choosing ceiling paint is quite a bit easier. But if you don’t, my choices below are the solution.Use the whites for ceilings. Use a flat finish.",
        "Also use these whites for cabinets, doors and trim, in a semi-gloss or gloss finish, but only if your surfaces are in excellent condition.Choosing dark accent walls is problematic. Though painters are willing to “cut in” paint color changes from wall to ceiling it never looks professional when there is a noticeable color contrast without crown molding to divide it. To be honest, I never liked the accent wall look to begin with.",
        "It looks great in Starbucks and other commercial applications but not in residences, and particularly not in today’s residences where the open floor plan is so prevalent. With all pale wall and ceiling colors there is little color contrast so you can go with a white ceiling if you like or even match the ceiling to the wall color.",
        "As long as they are soft and pale like the colors I’ve chosen for you below (with the exception of Miner’s Dust), the magnifying effect of colors bouncing off one another will be minimal.Go get a copy of my new book Shiree’s Interior Design and Lifestyle Tips.

In my work with advisors who have decided to bring LTC insurance into their practices, I hear a variety of reasons for adding the competency. The last advisor I worked with chose this time specifically because it’s an election year. We agreed that the imperative for people to plan will be heightened.",
        "The candidates will effectively do our marketing for us, as they talk about the lack of sustainability of the current Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security infrastructure.The climate of fiscal concern combined with unprecedented numbers of people approaching retirement brings tremendous opportunity.",
        "To help you explore whether to add LTCI to your core products, let’s explore some long-term care news and review the basics of designing a great policy.Why LTCI could take offIn October 2011, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced the Obama administration was pulling the plug on health care reform’s Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act (CLASS).CLASS was meant to provide employed Americans a long-term care insurance-like program.",
        "The program required no medical exam or health questions, and the law demanded that CLASS be fiscally self-sustaining (not relying on taxpayer money) and actuarially sound for a 75-year time period.Many in the insurance industry doubted the ability of the program to meet all these requirements, and the Obama administration finally came to the same conclusion.",
        "The abandonment of CLASS’ program implementation offers a poignant reminder to the public and to members of the insurance, health care and financial industries alike: it is crucial for consumers to be in the driver’s seat of their own long-term care planning, to not wait to plan, hoping for a government program.Another significant development in 2011 was the tremendous expansion of partnership states.",
        "A partnership policy is designed to allow policyholders to receive Medicaid long-term care benefits once their LTCI policies are exhausted, while retaining assets that would otherwise need to be spent down. Although partnership is not a new concept, it was only available in a handful of states until two years ago. Now, 38 states have partnership policies available for sale.The federal government has, for many years, offered tax incentives on the purchase of qualified LTCI policies.",
        "In addition, most states offer incentives for purchasers of long-term care insurance.For premiums paid by an individual, deductibility is determined by combining premium payments (subject to age-based limits) with unreimbursed medical expenses. If the total exceeds 7.5% of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income, the premium may be deductible for taxpayers who itemize.",
        "The following chart displays age-based limits on long-term care insurance deductibility:Companies may deduct long-term care insurance payments made for employees, their spouses and dependents. There is no requirement that the insurance be provided on a non-discriminatory basis, and the deduction is not limited to the age-based numbers shown in the chart.The increasing cost of careAs motivating as tax incentives can be, it’s rarely the motivating factor for someone to purchase a policy.",
        "Often, the motivation is something a bit more personal, such as the impact a need for long-term care would have on a consumer’s retirement finances and legacy planning. People who have witnessed a friend or family member who needed extended care are predisposed to purchasing insurance. They have witnessed firsthand the surprise when someone realizes that none of their traditional insurances covers long-term care.",
        "While no one enjoys a surprise bill of any sort, for many, the ultimate, unwanted financial surprise is the cost of long-term care.Since Medicare does sometimes pay for long-term care in the right situation, many people still mistakenly think that Medicare will take care of their future long-term care needs, no matter the circumstance or duration.",
        "Medicare has a limited skilled care (nursing home) benefit under certain conditions (100 days of care at a maximum) and a skilled care home care benefit under still different conditions (limited to medically necessary, non-daily visits that follow a hospital stay only). What most do not realize is that the vast majority of long-term care is not skilled, medically necessary care, but custodial care — meaning nonmedical care.",
        "Medicare, Medicare supplements and health insurance are not designed to cover nonmedical care. Long-term care insurance is the only insurance designed to cover the costs of nonmedical care.And these costs are high. The 2011 Genworth Cost of Care Survey examined the cost data on long-term care for every state. On the national level, the 2011 median hourly rate for a licensed home health aide was $19 ($152 for an eight-hour shift).",
        "The national median cost of an assisted living facility unit (one bedroom, single occupancy) was $3,261 per month. The national median rate for a private room in a nursing home was $193 per day (or $5,790 a month). Imagine how quickly this will eat through the average consumer’s retirement fund.",
        "The risk is, arguably, one that most Americans cannot afford without insurance.In his book “Fooled by Randomness,” risk engineering professor and financial guru Nassim Nicholas Taleb writes, “It is not how likely an event is that matters…it is the magnitude of the outcome that counts.” Most Americans buckle their seatbelts, just in case. They purchase fire insurance for their homes. They get an annual physical with their doctor.",
        "They are willing to endure minor inconveniences and expenses because they believe the magnitude of the risk in not taking action just doesn’t make sense. It’s time long-term care planning received the same diligence. Luckily, it’s easy for an agent to either begin to design and sell LTCI or to partner with an LTCI specialist.The past few years have been exciting in the field of long-term care insurance.",
        "If you are not yet bringing up long-term care planning to your clients, 2012 is the perfect time to change that!By Denise Jaehnke, CEPP, CLTCFrom the February 01, 2012 issue of Life Insurance SellingDenise Jaehnke, CEPP, CLTC, is president of Extended Personal Service Ltd"

He had the energy to go out and work on his car, his favorite hobby, but no mental power to make it happen.",

        "By Nash SwamyHedge funds have long been the envy of the investment industry, with complex and precisely executed trading strategies. While access to this group of funds remains with a select few, often institutional mandates or high net worth individuals, their presence is always felt and known by the average investor. But how have hedge funds been performing? The average investor often hears about the success of these rarefied funds, in the hope of being able to achieve similar returns.",
        "This year’s Canadian Hedge Funds Awards night, produced by Alternative IQ and sponsored in part by Fundata, is coming up on Oct. 16. So in this article I’ll lift the veil of mystery just a bit, and take a look at what made some of last year’s award-winners tick.Hedge funds are an essential tool for diversification of an investment portfolio, especially when markets are volatile and move in zig-zag patterns.",
        "You might have noticed a recent spate of articles with the general theme of “the return of volatility.” While this is one signal of market behavior, it can also be a call for investors to consider hedge funds and alternative strategies.The ratio of advancers-to-decliners in the past few years has been high, in essence testing the competence of hedge fund managers who consistently pursue long-short strategies. When the market is continually moving up, long-short strategies can be challenging.",
        "A fund might post high returns on its long positions, but these returns are cannibalized by the relatively low or even negative returns from short positions. This is possible in the market we have grown used to, where there is no volatility and markets continued to move in only one direction, up.As we look forward to this year’s CHFA Awards, it might be useful to look back at the past performance of some of Canada’s premier hedge funds in 2017.",
        "Listed in the table and graph below are selected hedge funds that were showcased for their 1-year return track record in their respective categories.The slope of return over risk is analyzed to categorize performance to yield one unit return for every unit of risk an investor accepts.",
        "Picton Mahoney manager Philip Mesman has been able to use his investment mandate to achieve alpha leading to a slope greater than 1 for its investors, being the top-performing fund amongst its peers.Shown in the table and graph below are a select few hedge funds that were showcased for the 5-year return track record in their respective categories.Note the Barometer Global Macro Pool is included for its exceptional performance in both 1-year and 5-year categories.Notable here is that the CC&L mandate uses an internal team dedicated to analyzing 12,000 stocks across developed and emerging equity markets daily on various quantitative factors.Donville Kent Capital Ideas Fund posted an impressive 12.79% return with an annualized standard deviation of 7.63%.",
        "The fund equates to a slope of 1.68, being the top-performing fund among its peers in the 5-year category.I spoke recently with Jesse Gamble, a portfolio manager at a Toronto-based hedge fund Donville Kent Asset Management, to find out what factors enabled the Donville Kent Capital Ideas Fund to rank among the best hedge funds in Canada:“What makes a good company is return on equity. We believe in the theory of reinvestment and compound returns,” said Gamble.",
        "“What creates a high ROE business is stable and improving margins at the company level. These companies offer an attractive risk-to-reward ratio as a byproduct of selecting excellent companies, hence effectively managing risk,” he added.According to Gamble, “While ROE is such a key metric, most managers simply look at profit and not ROE.",
        "Gauging the stability of ROE is incredibly important here at DKAM where we boil down the components and perform a DuPont analysis to see where the accretion and dilution in growth is coming from. We also take it one step further by looking at long-term contracts, margins, if the company has high barriers to entry, and what type of market in which it operates.In addition to crunching the numbers, DKAM also focuses on corporate management.",
        "“We like to know that the management of these superstar companies speak our language,” says Gamble. “We need to know that management knows and understands the company and industry,” he added.Gamble concludes that this type of in-depth research “will help facilitate management to effectively deploy capital to offer high returns for shareholders.",
        "This is how we continue to excel in the hedge fund space and offer great returns to our investors.”Achieving high risk-adjusted returns is challenging in an extremely competitive hedge fund universe. But with strong quantitative and qualitative analysis, as well as looking beyond profitability and attractive top and bottom numbers, you may be able to invest in something worth multiple times what the market has priced for such companies."

Magazines and their editors, companies, famous chefs and bloggers all engage extensively with the app, which allows users to share their moments across the web in one click.",
        "Some say that it’s the lure of the images which makes Instagram more immediate, and therefore more attractive than any other mobile platform. Others blame it on gossip: in fact when it comes to celebrities, images with personal content often happen to be the ones with most likes. The rules of popularity in mobile photo sharing vary depending on the occasion. Here we have created a compilation that showcases some of the most influential gourmands across the App. 1.",
        "THE SOCIAL PHENOMENONS When in 2012 the Norway-raised, Berlin-based Ida Skivenes (idafrosk on Instagram) started composing cute figures on her breakfast plate, she couldn’t imagine that in less than two years she would have more than 270k followers on Instagram, plus the consequent opportunity to leave her day job to dedicate herself 100% on creating edible artwork.",

        "On the other hand the LA based Julie Lee (julieskitchen on Instagram), composes beautiful collages using the uber-healthy ingredients that go into her recipes (she talked about in an interview with Fine Dining Lovers here).",
        "The list of creative foodies who have built impressive careers starting from an influential Instagram account surely doesn’t end here: photographer and blogger Alice Gao’s pictures of neat home corners and inviting table settings, will averagely collect more than 10.000 likes in less than 15 minutes.

        "Home & Garden Columns.Unless specified, a contractor isn’t obliged to have anything more to do with your job than to sign the contract, take a deposit and wish you well. And, of course, make sure that somebody does the job in accordance with the specific provisions of the contract (your contract had lots of specifics, right? like assuring the contractor would call you, talk to you, tell you everything was O.K. and they have enjoyed the time they shared with you).",
        "It’s a cruel world out there, and then, your health care gets voted on by congress. Time to wake up and smell the sawdust.Now, don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying that contract law allows contractors to defraud the public and vacate promises of work. It does not, but it says very little about who you have actually hired.",
        "Ask around, and you will find more than a few folks who, having hired a given contractor, often because of their trust in that particular person, later found themselves working with a gang of subordinates who cast a sorry or limp shadow of the absent hero.So, it’s a good idea, when you sit down with the contractor you’re hoping to work with to ask whether they will be doing the work.",
        "Often, the answer will be that they will be checking on the work from time to time, but they won’t actually be swinging a hammer.",
        "If you never ask, you might never know until the work is well under way.One can specify in a contract that one wishes the contractor to be on-site and perform certain services (within some reasonable bounds, indentured servitude now being largely outlawed), but this is a very slippery slope, and I would argue that it’s always better to start off by hiring someone to do things the way that they are accustomed to doing them.",
        "Then the marriage has a chance.Many small contractors (2–5 person firms) will be on-site much of the time anyway, and if you’re looking for that boutique experience, you might want to stay with a highly ranked person in a company of roughly that size.",
        "Once a contractor has more than, say, 6 or 7 persons on staff, nobody is going to see them all that much of the time, since the lion’s share of their energies will be going into keeping all those other people productive, efficient and paid.As contractors, our lives and days change as we evolve into business-folk. We change hats and clothing, manners and venues. Many don’t make the switch. Some back up, drop down to handyman status or leave entirely. Some find the upward-mobility a natural ride.",
        "It varies with each contractor and each has their own gifts and curses.Discerning these attributes should be the mission of the consumer. Shopping for contractors is like figuring out what kind of suit you’re looking for (or overall, or ripped tee). Will they be on-site? Will they supervise well? Will I get a good deal? Will the work be to my liking? Will I enjoy the experience and feel taken care of? These needs will vary with the buyer (yes, you will bring much to this table) and the contractor.",
        "Small can be very intimate and make a lot of room for positive change and adaptation, even though it can be slower. Larger firms are often quicker and can usually tackle tougher problems.",
        "They may also have plusses that a small one does not, such as a connection with an engineer or architect.There is no one model for everyone, but there is one element in this equation that is worth asking and learning about and that is the job-site foreman or superintendent.These mini-contractors are both employee and boss. They are liaison and worker. Often, they are a job boss (telling everyone else what to do) and organizer, but above all, they are yours.",
        "These sergeants in the field of contracting hold sufficient rank to do all the things your absent contractor cannot, and, often as not, will do better carpentry and clean up than the boss.Now just as contractors vary, a foreman comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Meeting a proposed foreman during the shopping phase is an awfully good idea. If there are several foremen (these can, of course, be women) then meet them all, just in case there’s a switch.",
        "It is quite common, in my experience for these persons to be quite similar in a given company since they will reflect the predelictions of the boss (ever meet two or three ex-husbands of the same woman?).The job foreman is empowered to make a range of decisions, but this will have its limits. They may have to consult with the general contractor or wait for a call back on some issues, but this is a finer point.",
        "The take-home message here is that if you have a foreman dedicated to your job and you like them, you will often be happier than the person who has the contractor on-site every day. The politics of this are sort of like good-cop, bad cop. There is face-saving too.",
        "The foreman “feels” like they belong to you when they’re on your site and they can “seem” to go to bat against the contractor to get you more of this or less of that because they have an investment in you and the outcome of “their” job.",
        "It’s very much like organizational politics and you’re the winner if you have a stalwart foreman that you like and with whom you have a good working relationship.If you are thinking of working with a mid-sized contractor who does not use a foreman or superintendent system, think again. This is often a sign that the contractor has either not matured organizationally, or is just cheap (which is also foolish).",
        "For contractors, spending enough to keep people happy is smart business, and no successful contractor can last long with a string of unhappy clients dragging behind them. The ones that shine, are those who spend enough to keep the jobs moving along at an appropriate pace and keep good replicas of themselves on-site to create, solve and please."

He was a syndicated columnist who wrote a column that was carried by the Washington Post for years called the \"Real Estate Mailbag\".I know very little about Real Estate but when I started searching for my very first home about 5 years ago I started paying attention to his column.",
        "He was sort of the \"Dear Abby of Real Estate\". People would write him with very specific questions about home buying and he'd basically teach fundamentals. He wrote very plainly and knowledgeably and I must admit that I looked forward to reading his column long after I bought my house.You see, there is some part of my character or personality that really, really admires excellence.",
        "When I was a kid even though I didn't really like certain sports or performances, whenever I had the chance to see someone do anything--act, sing, write, serve a volleyball, walk on a balance beam--if they were really excellent I was always thrilled and enchanted. That may be part of the reason that the people I love most in my life (such as my best friends and most certainly my wife) are really excellent at what they do.",
        "I'm just awed by people who make what would be for me, difficult things, look so easy I guessThere are a lot of people out there like Robert Bruss. And I hope that I can do a better job in my life of giving credit where credit is due before it's too late. Rest in Peace Mr. Bruss. You helped me and a lot of other people figure out what seemed unfigureoutable. Thanks. -Monica"

Sex accounts can accept a huge occupation in engaging fretfulness by stimulating your magnetism and empowering you to see the value in some pleasurable and satisfying sex not long prior to slipping into a tranquil and medicinal rest cycle.",

        "SANDUSKYThe federal government is investigating former city employee Mark Warren.On April 1, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S.",
        "Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a subpoena to city officials to turn over \"any and all documents\" relating to the Community Housing Improvement Program.According to Carrie Handy, the city's chief planner, the government confiscated 30 boxes of files later that month.Although the federal agents gave the city enough time to inventory the documents, there wasn't enough time to make copies, she said.Since that time, the Inspector General's office also has subpoenaed company files from at least three of the seven contractors who worked with Warren on the CHIP program.Both federal and city officials confirmed an investigation is ongoing, but officials couldn't give a timetable when charges might be brought.\"We'd rather it be sooner than later,\" said Don Iscman, the city's law director.",
        "\"But (the Inspector General's office) is shorthanded and short-staffed like everyone else. ...",
        "I expect it might be a while longer.\"According to Handy, Warren and the contractors stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from the city -- possibly more.Between 2004 and 2006, the city received $1.5 million in CHIP grants, as well as $500,000 in Community Block Development Grants.The city had to give $63,000 in funds back to the government, but the other $1.937 million was used for the housing programs.Handy said the contractors charged the city for unnecessary and expensive projects -- which Warren, the city's housing rehabilitation specialist, approved -- and then provided shoddy work or no work at all to the houses.",
        "Nearly every house -- and possibly all of them -- received inadequate work, she said.\"You went to the houses, and you wondered if these people even knew what straight lines were or what right angles were,\" she said.The seven contractors involved in the program were New Horizon Development, Porter Home Improvement, Helmstetter Home Improvement, Girasol Remodeling, Allicock Construction, E & M Remodeling and Boger Quality Builders.Handy, who had to provide significant evidence to government officials before they would take the case, said all seven contractors provided suspect work.Nonetheless, she couldn't say whether they were all involved in a scam to steal money from the city, or they were just incompetent.In one instance, a contractor ignored a faulty foundation \"and the house could have caved in,\" she said.",
        "Instead, they replaced relatively new windows with cheaper windows and charged the city an exorbitant amount of money.They billed $700 for a water heater at one home and $2,700 for a water heater at another home.Victoria Irby sued the city -- and the suit is still pending -- because she needed a $1,200 repair for her roof and ended up receiving $25,000 in shoddy repairs, including a whole new roof.",
        "Her roof now leaks worse than ever.\"What they really did is hurt the homeowners,\" Handy said, because the homeowners have to pay the government back when they sell their houses. If they stay in their houses five years, then they only have to reimburse the government for 50 percent of the repairs.",
        "But for someone like Irby, that is $12,500.The Inspector General's office couldn't \"confirm or deny an ongoing investigation,\" but the subpoenas indicated an investigation was ongoing, Iscman said.According to Ohio Revised Code Sections 2913.02 and 2929.14, if Warren is found guilty of embezzling more than $500,000, he would face two to 10 years in prison.But a federal official said defendants often make deals in cases like this.",
        "Warren could name contractors who have violated the law, he said, and in return he could receive a reduced sentence."

        "In a large bowl, combine chopped veggies, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning with 3 tablespoons olive oil, tossing to coat. Arrange in an even layer on a large foil lined baking sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until tomatoes burst and garlic and onion are golden.While the veggies roast, grill the chicken. Season trimmed chicken breasts with salt and pepper- over both sides. Arrange chicken on a grill rack coated with cooking spray; grill 5-7 minutes.",
        "Turn chicken over; grill 5-7 minutes or until done and juices run clear. Remove from the grill and allow chicken to rest for 5-10 minutes.Slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces. In a large mixing bowl combine roasted veggies and their juices, cooked pasta, ¼ cup olive oil, and parmesan cheese. Toss to coat evenly. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot!mmmm..

        "Between the Lines: The Warren BumpLooking back to early August, it now seems funny that Sen.",
        "Scott Brown’s campaign website would trumpet a collection of quotes mocking Democrats for giving Elizabeth Warren a prime speaking position at the party’s Charlotte convention.“What’s unclear is whether Warren is the ideal surrogate to deliver that red-meat rhetoric in front of a national television audience,” wrote the National Journal’s Josh Kraushaar, while NBC legacy hire Luke Russert tweeted, “Hard to see the benefit of #Dems giving Warren a prime time slot at DNC considering she’s such a lightning rod for criticism.”.”Of course, a funny thing happened at the conventions.",
        "All the “We Built That” attacks at the Republican National Convention fell flat, with polling showing little bounce for Mitt Romney. But when Democrats, including Warren, doubled down on their populist message, they were rewarded with a significant bump in the polls.“President Obama believes in a country where we invest in education, in roads and bridges, in science and in the future, so we can create new opportunities,” Warren said at the convention.",
        "“We grow [the economy of the future] with opportunity. And we build it together.” That’s the message that helped Obama expand his lead in both national and battleground polling, and which has now led Warren to. 17 after showing Brown leading 48-47 in May.",
        "The Republican consulting firm Kimball Political had Brown winning 49-43 immediately before the GOP convention, and leading just 46-45 after the Democratic one.Those aforementioned pundits truly failed to understand the appeal Warren brings to the campaign. Rather than a disaster for the Democratic Party and Obama, it’s clear Warren’s keynote boosted her chances and contributed to a dramatically successful Democratic convention.",
        "They saw her off-the-charts fundraising as a sign of overt liberal partisanship, but her appeal doesn’t lie in partisan rhetoric.Rather than simply talk about the struggle between the middle class and a system rigged against them, she has lived that fight. As the architect and first head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, she has been a lone figure reining in a financial sector run amok.",
        "In fact, the nascent agency scored its biggest victory recently by forcing Capital One to refund $150 million in fees directly into the accounts of 2.5 million customers, in addition to another $60 million in fines.Yes, this is the kind of action that inspires liberals, but it’s also the kind of practical populism that wins broad-based public support.",
        "Warren’s speaking slot was validation that today’s Democratic Party is no longer afraid of its beliefs or disapproval from Beltway hacks like Luke Russert.Voters got a look at both the Warren message and the selfish Republican one, and the polling couldn’t be clearer on which resonated best with voters.Markos Moulitsas is founder and publisher of Daily Kos and a columnist at The Hill."

I will be hand watering these until I get the automatic watering system in place.Tomorrow I hope to start a new Biointensive compost pile by the nursery.",

        "I’ve been working on a project recently looking at lack of awareness of the Internet. In the U.S. we take for granted that most people know what the Internet is and have a general sense of what it can do, even if they don’t use it themselves.",
        "However, even in the U.S., there were (and still are) people that don’t know what the Internet is.In the Caucasus, not knowing what “the Internet” implies is not uncommon in some places – 1% of Armenians, 22% of Azerbaijanis, and 7% of Georgians report that they don’t know what “the Internet” is (in 2010).Who are these people?",
        "They’re older, they’re rural, they have less education, and they’re poorer.And, generally, people that are not aware of what “the Internet” is are highly unlikely to ever use the Internet.The next step is ever using the Internet.",
        "In Armenia, two-thirds of citizens have never used the Internet, a little over half (55%) of Azerbaijanis have never used it, and 61% of Georgians have never used it (in 2010).Again, the people that are not using tend to be older, more rural, less educated, and poorer.Finally, the last Internet hurdle is frequent use. Many Caucasus “Internet users” are getting online less than once a month. Certainly these infrequent users are not fully benefiting from Internet use.",
        "10% of Armenians, 11% of Azerbaijanis, and 11% of Georgians are online quite infrequently.So while official statistics from the ITU say that 37% of Armenians, 36% of Azerbaijanis, and 27% of Georgians are online because they define “Internet user” as going online once or more ever, I’d argue that this is adoption, and we should really be discussing frequent users (at least weekly).",
        "In that case, 21% of Armenians, 9% of Azerbaijanis, and 18% of Georgians are fully benefiting from Internet use.Who are those frequent users? They’re generally urban (although in Armenia and to some degree Georgia, there are some rural frequent users, mostly via mobile Internet), better educated, younger, and wealthier.At least we can see that there has been an increase in awareness, use, and frequent use since 2009.",
        "In 2009 71% of Armenians, 62% of Azerbaijanis, and 65% of Georgians knew what the Internet was, and 15% of Armenians, 14% of Azerbaijanis, and 17% of Georgians had ever used it. Frequent users in 2009 were 8% of Armenians, 6% of Azerbaijanis, and 10% of Georgians."

        "For comparison’s sake, women’s champion Orange Coast beat runner-up Diablo Valley by three points.Of the three-day meet’s five relays, the Bear Cub men won four and had one fourth-place finish.SRJC swim and dive coach Jill McCormick said success in the relays is all but required for winning a state title because a relay win awards double the points of an individual win.“If you’re winning the relay battle, you usually win the meet,” McCormick said.",
        "“We knew they were super important, and we built our entire lineup around the relays.”Friday’s 200-yard medley relay by Sean Malley, John Bing, Trent Williams and Nolan Stimple shattered a 14-year-old state record by 2.13 seconds.",
        "That race, with a time of 1:29.99, was named performance of the meet.“There were national records set by other kids this weekend, and they gave that award to us,” said McCormick, who was named men’s coach of the year.The men came into Saturday with a massive 155-point lead. The Bear Cubs’ point total after two days was better than Palomar’s three-day sum.McCormick said the huge lead was liberating.“People tend to swim very fast when they’re mentally relaxed,” she said.",
        "“We knew with the situation we were in that no one was going to catch us. We knew we could absorb a mistake.“I just told them, ‘We’re making history today … You guys put your heart and soul out there the first two days … so go out there and leave your mark and enjoy every minute of it.’”The relay teams weren’t the only ones turning in record-setting performances for the Bear Cubs. Freshman diver Suissa set a state record in the 1-meter diving on Friday.",
        "Suissa, who swept the men’s diving events, was named diver of the year.Suissa’s coach, Nolan Irwin, was selected diving coach of the year in his first full season. Irwin stepped into the job last year after the sudden death of longtime coach Tim Nobriga, who had been planning to retire at the end of last season.“We were kind of grooming Nolan to be the head coach last year, and he just kind of jumped in in the middle of all that,” she said.“Nolan has been (Nobriga’s) protege.",
        "… He’s a young coach, but he’s phenomenal. This year was proof of that.”For the women, freshman Alexandria Holland, who starred at Maria Carrillo, won three events and was named women’s co-swimmer of the year. She set a school record in the 200-yard individual medley Friday.Eric Wittmershaus is The Press Democrat's online sports editor. You can reach him at 521-5433 or eric.wittmershaus@pressdemocrat.com."

        "Women's contributions to ag make up Common ThreadsBecause so many farms have been in the family for several generations, many of them have a man’s name attached.",
        "But in 21st century California, women’s contributions to agriculture and their communities can’t be overstated.That’s why women from the Central Valley and Northern California are recognized each year with Common Threads Awards, recognizing individuals who have made a remarkable and visible contribution to the enhancement of their communities.“These women are the unsung heroes who often serve behind the scenes but who play important roles in agriculture,” said Barry Bedwell, president of the California Agricultural Leadership Foundation, which helped establish the awards in 1997.“They are individuals who are dedicated to the success of their families, their farms, and their communities but also agriculture as a whole.”This year, five women are being honored in the greater Fresno area and five others from northern parts of the state for their contributions.",
        "(Although the program criteria are the same, the two organizations that select the winners are separate.) An awards luncheon was held in Clovis on March 27, while the North State dinner will be held on April 4 in Chico.Farm Credit proudly supports both programs because they recognize the important role of women in agriculture, said Leili Ghazi, western regional president for CoBank, a part of the Farm Credit System.“Women today have important leadership roles in all sectors of the economy, and agriculture is no exception,” Ghazi said.",
        "“Women like the Common Thread Award winners have helped make California’s farming community the world leader, and we’re delighted to help salute their achievements.”The Common Threads North recipients are:- Kathy Chance, a longstanding advocate for Butte County agriculture including being founding director of the Butte Ag Foundation and chair of the California Nut Festival.- Patty Merwin, who has devoted decades to community service in Yolo County in roles where she can quietly help, including the Clarksburg Community Church, the Yolo County Elections Department, and the area’s suicide hotline.- Edele Norman, a charter member of the San Joaquin County chapter of California Women for Agriculture and longstanding volunteer with the Ripon 4-H Club and Ripon Future Farmers of America.- Judith Redmond, a founding partner in Full Belly Farm in Yolo County’s Capay Valley and a recognized national leader in organic farming who also promotes agricultural literacy and has served on numerous state and local advisory boards.- And Cherie Stephens, owner of Stephens Farmhouse farm stand and bakery in Sutter County who has given thousands of dollars and countless hours to organizations benefiting the community.The San Joaquin Valley honorees are:- Kathy Briano, who grew up on the family farm in Porterville but launched a career in retail clothing, only to return to her roots when her father died from cancer.",
        "Learning as she went, she has grown the operation to over 300 acres of diversified farmland and through volunteer efforts works hard every day to ensure there’s a future for agriculture in the region.- Tina Carreiro, who with her husband converted an old home in Hanford into apartments while she worked as a bank operations manager and her husband was a ranch superintendent. They later purchased 80 acres and began farming nights and weekends.",
        "The business has flourished – in part because of her famous demand: “Sharpen your pencil!”- Giovanna DePaoli grew up on a farm near Porterville. Today, with husband David, they farm over 400 acres of almonds, cherries, and citrus.",
        "Besides spending time with her seven granddaughters, she spends time in the almond orchard checking the sprinklers and being involved in the everyday decisions.- Marcia Shafer’s first job was picking grapes and laying them down to become raisins in Parlier and today lives on a Parlier-area ranch that’s been in her husband’s family for five generations.",
        "She is senior vice president with Zenith Insurance, is involved in numerous ag organizations, and serves as a mentor for people seeking careers in agriculture.- Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims is receiving an honorary award for her advocacy for agriculture and support of farmers during her career, which saw her become the first woman sergeant, lieutenant, captain, and assistant sheriff before being elected sheriff in her own right.In previous years, 115 women have received the award – named because women honored are the “common threads” that hold together their businesses, families, and communities – in the Fresno area, while 61 have been honored in the north.###.About the Common Threads Awards: The program was established in 1997 by the California Agricultural Leadership Foundation, California State University, Fresno, and the university’s Ag One Foundation to honor Central Valley women in agriculture who make a philanthropic difference in their communities and our world.",

        "Georgia Wildlife Resources Division2070 U.S. Hwy. 278, SE, Social Circle, GA 30025The 2001 hunting season was the 23rd year of our annual turkey population survey. The continuing cooperation of turkey hunters has made the survey possible. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. The information you provide is valuable in several ways.In 2001, 493 broods were seen..96 poults seen in 2001 did not differ significantly from 7.15 the previous year.",
        "The statewide production index of poults per observer (21.34) was up slightly from last year's 18.22. The average number of poults per hen was 2.2 in 2001. An average of 3.0 or above is considered an indicator of good production. These data suggest that on a statewide basis turkey production is still somewhat depressed and can be considered at best fair, especially compared to the excellent reproduction in 1993-95.",
        "Cyclic, up-and-down trends are a natural aspect observed in wildlife populations, especially in turkeys as reproduction can be greatly affected by unpredictable, spring weather conditions. The continuing drought in Georgia can also impact reproductive success because of decreased insect production and reduced habitat quality.",
        "Managing for quality habitat should remain a priority to avoid additional limitations during seasons of low production and to take advantage of when production begins to cycle upward again. Overall, our total population is still excellent and should remain so in the foreseeable future.This survey is conducted during the spring gobbler season with hunt data being supplied by hunter volunteers.",
        "Specific information requested about each hunting trip from our hunter cooperators is the date, hours hunted, county or region of the state hunted, the number of turkeys seen, and the number of gobblers heard. The number of gobblers killed is asked for but is optional.The hours of hunting effort per turkey observed is used as an index of the hunting population.",
        "The correlation between this index and the production index is used in evaluating annual production and resulting hunting season populations.Hunt information in usable form was supplied by 526 of the 2,000 hunters contacted in 2001. They reported making 4,603 trips totaling 16,883 hunting hours. The season hunting effort per cooperator was 9.0 trips totaling 32.1 hours. This is a decrease of 3 hours from the 2000 season average effort.A total of 9,960 turkeys (hens and gobblers) were seen.",
        "The statewide population index of 1.7 hunting hours per turkey seen matched the previous year and was again among the lowest ever documented during the 21 years surveyed. The lowest effort per bird seen was in the Piedmont Plateau counties, and the greatest was in the Appalachian Highlands and Blue Ridge Mountain counties.Cooperators reported hearing 7,374 gobblers. The hours of hunting per gobbler heard averaged 2.4 hours.",
        "Good to excellent reproductive success in 1993-95 along with an abundance of adult gobblers once again were factors contributing to the continued low hunting effort per gobbling bird in 2001. Similar to previous seasons, the least amount of time hunting per gobbler heard, 1.8 hours, was in the Piedmont Plateau, and the greatest amount of time, 5.4 hours, was in the Blue Ridge Mountains.",
        "Statewide, peak gobbling activity, 3.9 gobblers per trip, occurred during the middle of April.The statewide harvest during the first seven days of the season accounted for 30.0% of the total season harvest. The average amount of hunting effort to kill a gobbler, 27.9 hours, increased by 1.3 hours from 2000. Statewide hunter success dropped significantly to 46.6% with 245 of the 526 cooperators taking at least one bird.",
        "Of these, 103 (42%) hunters took one bird, 79 (32.2%) took two birds, and 63 (25.7%) took three birds. Cooperators reported 42 gobblers killed by companions.Georgia's estimated 83,923 turkey hunters had only a fair spring season in 2001 harvesting about 52,871 birds statewide. The average harvest per hunter (0.59) was down slightly from 0.63 in 2000. Across the state the 2002 spring season in general should be fair to good again depending upon the weather.",
        "Because reproduction has been down somewhat the past three years there are fewer jakes and two-year-old birds this season. However, overall the state's turkey population is still very strong. Hopefully, reproduction will rebound and the future will remain bright for Georgia's number one game bird. Good luck and good hunting."

        "Back in January, I wrote about 10 uncommon seeds that we planned to start. Of the ten only three germinated: orange scented thyme, jujube, and raisin tree and the thyme died soon after germination. That’s not as bad as it sounds; in fact, it’s excellent because it’s difficult if not impossible to find jujube and raisin tree in Canada.",
        "The eight others can be obtained from other sources.March 2, 2011 SeedlingsRaisin TreeJujubeAugust 7, 2011 PlantsJujubeRaisin TreeBecause the three jujubes, while starting to be pot bound, are still quite small, I’ll probably overwinter them inside this year. It’s difficult to pin down exactly how hardy they are. I’ve seen temperatures ranges of -10℉ to -20℉. Once they are large enough, they should survive here. I’ll probably do the same for the raisin tree although it’s much larger."

        "Economist David Rosenberg believes the bond market is getting inflation right and yields shouldn’t trade at higher levels.His reasoning: Inflation as a temporary phenomenon caused by enormous pent-up demand and supply chain issues connected to the coronavirus pandemic.“The numbers have been shocking to the upside, no doubt about it. But it’s pretty easily explainable,” the Rosenberg Research president told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday.",
        "“I don’t understand why people want to superimpose these last couple of months into the future.”So far, the bond market is shrugging off inflation. The benchmark 10-year Treasury Note yield hit its lowest level since March 3 on Friday and closed at 1.45%.",
        "The yield is off 7% over the last week and down almost 11% over the past month.Sliding yields have been on Rosenberg’s radar for months.In late February on “Trading Nation,” Rosenberg called the bond market “radically oversold” and predicted the 10-year yield would retreat to 1%. At the time, the yield was around 1.5%.“There is just so much noise and distortion in the data,” said Rosenberg, who served as Merrill Lynch’s top North American economist from 2002 to 2009.",
        "“The most dangerous thing anybody can do is extrapolate what’s happening now.”“I refuse to hyperventilate over inflation.”David RosenbergIn a note to investors on Friday, he wrote “I refuse to hyperventilate over inflation.” He believes the other side of surging growth is a plateau.“That’s the story for the second half of the year… The bond market is sniffing that out right now,” Rosenberg said.",
        "“My forecast is slower growth, inflation peaking out and rolling over and a bull flattening in the yield curve.”It’s an outlook that would spell trouble for the reopening trade. Rosenberg predicts consumer cyclicals, a major part of it, will fall out of favor later this year.“Growth should reclaim leadership over value in the stock market,” he said.",
        "“You want to be more in defensive growth and in areas of the market that are going to benefit from a lower bond yield.”Rosenberg may be expecting trouble for the reopening trade, but he also believes bitcoin is prime for a resurgence.",
        "The cryptocurrency has been getting walloped, down 38% over the past two months.He also wrote on Friday about encouraging signs that show bitcoin is getting ready for “another shot upwards.” He further suggested technicals indicate overbought conditions are unwinding.Yet, he still won’t completely embrace the asset.“I don’t own bitcoin. I never recommended anybody to buy it. It seems to me that crypto is here to stay.",
        "There is no doubt about it as a facilitator, of a medium of exchange,” he said. “Bitcoin, to me, is a speculative trade. I don’t see it as a bonafide investment.”Rosenberg prefers gold, an asset he has owned for years.“I just say buy the gold,” Rosenberg said. “Gold has 1/5 of the volatility that bitcoin has.”Gold is up 8% over the past two months. However, it’s off about one percent so far this year."

        "The.The model showed that rising temperatures and a growing number of weather-related disasters now cause more migration than lack of income or political freedom.Each 10 per cent increase in temperature in an origin country caused an increase of 3 per cent in migration from that country to the 16 destination countries, which included Australia, Italy, Spain and Germany.“Both developed and at-risk countries need more planning and policy to prepare for what is likely to be a growing trend of people wanting to move.Dennis Wesselbaum, economist, Otago Business SchoolThe study, published last month in the journal Global and Planetary Change, also found that this migration happens in stages.Dennis Wesselbaum, the lead researcher and an economist at the Otago Business School, explains that migration actually decreased for around five years after a temperature anomaly, before increasing for the next 20 years.“One explanation is that people move to places further away and have to save more money to finance migration cost, [or] that it takes time to identify the temperature shock,” Wesselbaum told SciDev.Net.Raya Muttarak, senior lecturer of geography and international development at the UK’s University of East Anglia, believes another reason for the apparent delay is that people at first try “in-situ adaptation”..Around 244 million people—2.8 per cent of the world’s population—were classed as migrants in 2015 by the UN.",
        "However, the UN has said it will not define climate migrants as refugees, a status that comes with more international support, citing concerns about watering down support programmes for those fleeing violent conflict.A report by the UNFCC, the UN’s climate change body, found last year that, globally, countries are largely failing to deal with climate migration adequately.“Recognising the causal factors behind this forced migration would require governments to apportion responsibility, both for the initial migration and for the solutions to it,” said Steve Trent, director of the Environmental Justice Foundation, which lobbies on environmental issues in the Global South.“In many countries this is politically toxic and, without international agreement on shared and coordinated action, proves politically very hard to deal with.”Wesselbaum is confident, however, that the problem will be recognised “sooner or later”, adding that the results of his study offer a more nuanced understanding of how people respond to climate shocks.The climate migration model showed that migration remained stable after storms and drought, but increased significantly after floods and extreme temperature events.“Both developed and at-risk countries need more planning and policy to prepare for what is likely to be a growing trend of people wanting to move,” Wesselbaum added.This piece was produced by SciDev.Net’s Global"

I'm with you Averill, would love to have a bedroom such as that. I don't compromise much in decorating. Husband is pretty tolerant of my crazy style. I did do a guest bedroom here in Houston with a vintage 70's wallpaper (looks like a Pucci design). It has a bold orchid/pink color in it.",
        "I thought my brother in law was going to faint when I showed him his room when he came to stay from Scotland. I won't even get started about that earth shattering walk-in closet. OMG!!!Averill, this room is one of my all-time faves. I love the way Jamie Drake is fearless with color.Averill-I heard Jamie Drake speak last week at the Corcoran-quite a charming man. I am as girly as they come and pink is my favorite color.",
        "I was smart enough to marry a man who has no interest in interior design and is color blind. Needless to say, I do as I wish. But the only room in my house that is all pink is my dressing room that nobody goes in but me. But in other rooms I use touches of pink. Pink is my beige.oooh la la! i swear i would keep my closet clean if it looked like the one above! i always tell the boys i am going to get my own condo down the street and just visit them with groceries every few days.",
        "if i did, i could have a bedroom like that!.Two things right now, though: He's not sure about my painting the headboards for Avery's big girl room redo, and I'm trying to figure out a way to get rid of this hideous \"pirate trunk\" we have from his grandparent's estate without him noticing! ;)Oh wow, I'm loving all of the pink! And that closet is absolutely amazing! :)OMG that closet!! Did you notice that the bench fabric matches an outfit that's in the closet?",
        "I love that the handbag storage looks like a boutique display. No pink in my house now. Hubby like darks, and I like lights. I've mostly won, but he really wanted a dark room - hence our the tiny brown guest room. Only it looks more like poo than Hershey's! :( He thinks it's cozy, I think it's dark and depressing.",
        "More decorating must be done in that space...??At first glance, I thought all of the pink was overwhelming but, as you pointed out, I think Jamie Drake did a great job giving it a more grown-up vibe with the furnishings. I love that lucite desk chair -- and the closet...wow...put a cot in there and I would live in that closet :).The way to get your pink fix as an adult is to have little girls!",
        "I decorated the room of one of my girls in pink - delicate pink on the walls, a beautiful balloon shade in pink and white toile, a white blanket cover with a big pink monogram in the center, complete with matching euro. She tolerates the whole scheme now, but we have alread painted over the pink on the walls as she decided she did not like it. Oh well!My husband doesn't give to much guidance on decor choices, but he does have veto power. I keep it fairly neutral.",
        "The bedroom is actually more on the feminine side (I am going to do a post on it soon), but because it is done in blues and whites, the color scheme does not translate as feminine, even though the scallops on the blanket cover, the curves on the mirror, and monograms on the pillows are definitely feminine touches!.Wow that is one gorgeous bedroom and closet. I adore it. I am a sort of girly girl. Okay, a total girly girl - even though my house is decorated as such, because I too am married!",
        "I have been given free reign in our guest room though, and it's totally cutesy.Loved this post Averill!Each space is delightfully pretty in pink :) I love the touches of gold and lucite, such as the mirror in image 02 -- so decadent against the clean wall behind. The armoire has that wow factor, with a grown-up flair. As for that closet? I don't even know where to begin...if I went in there, I don't think the jaws of life could get me out again...!"

        "Backyard Renovation: Remove grass, cut small tree, trim shrubs, walkway, patio and vegetable gardenI contacted Assiniboine to renovate a section of my 3-tier backyard by removing a small tree, trimming 2 shrubs, removing grass to create a walkway, a large patio and vegetable gardens. The estimator came a week later and I gave him a fixed budget to work with. He came back promptly to suggest a 25' stone walkway, a 15' x 14' patio and 2 vegetable garden areas of 10' x 4' each.",
        "He even suggested using the existing paver stones in my yard to use with new bricks for the vegetable garden border to save cost, which I thought was a great idea.Within a week, the project manager Anka contacted me and discussed about my likes and dislikes, etc. He was able to arrange for his crew to start 3 days before the original scheduled date. On Friday, the day of construction, the crew worked tirelessly ripping up the grass by hand (because my backyard is inaccessible to machineries).",
        "Within a day, they were able to prep the area to start laying the bricks the following day. These men worked long hours through the weekend, and during that time we made some minor changes to the design and those guys were very accommodating.",
        "In the end, some of the changes resulted in less bricks used and a pallet of bricks was returned to their supplier.The only unfortunate thing was that this wasn't communicated properly back to their HQ and when the project was completed, I was charged extra for bricks that were not used. However, the company was able to verify this situation quickly with the project manager and the revised charges were then waived without any issue.",
        "By Monday, the work was done to my satisfaction.To be clear, they are not the cheapest landscaper if you shop around. But if you want quality work and a landscaper who sticks to the budget, then Assiniboine is worthy of consideration. Plus, they provide 2 year limited hardscape warranty pertaining to workmanship defects, which I hope I won't have to use!"

        "They will now battle the USA for the gold medal at 5am AEST on Monday morning as they seek to replicate their performance from 2006 when they were crowned FIBA World Cup Champions.After breezing through their first four games of the tournament, the Opals were forced to fight until the final siren against Spain and trailed by eight points at three-quarter time.Liz Cambage (33 points, 15 rebounds, four blocks) had enjoyed a battle against the Spanish front court (and the crowd) throughout the game but she was determined not to let this one slip, scoring six quick points to open the fourth quarter.Katie Ebzery drilled a corner three as well to give the Opals a 9-0 run and then Astor Ndour, Spanish starting forward, fouled out.Cambage flirted with fouling out herself after a technical but Laura Nicholls fouled out instead for Spain only a couple of minutes later and the visitors were in the bonus with the game tied inside the last 3:30.Cayla George (nine points, 11 rebounds, two assists) then stepped up, scoring five in a row including a big three-pointer from an offensive rebound to gain the ascendancy and Australia picked up their defensive intensity as well with blocks from Cambage and O'Hea.The two combined again on the following possession with O'Hea (four points, two assists) picking up the steal and Cambage finishing a broken play with a lay-up.That put the Opals up by five and they staved off a Spanish miracle with more lockdown defence, preventing any late three-point attempts as they finished the game with an 8-1 run and a 22-8 final term..@ECambage and Opals break Spanish hearts 💔 to set up #FIBAWWC Final against USA!",
        "@BasketballAUS @BaloncestoFEB #ESPAUSStory ➡Highlights ⤵ pic.twitter.com/zEC1HnYD9w— FIBA (@FIBA) September 29, 2018The game did not look like it was headed to a thrilling conclusion after the Opals dominated the first quarter, a trademark of their 2018 FIBA World Cup campaign.They pushed the pace early, beating Spain in transition even off made baskets and Bec Allen (eight points, two steals) maintained her form from the Quarter-Final with an early three-pointer while Steph Talbot (two points, eight assists) also impressed.Cambage recorded nine points to quarter-time as well, putting her team up by 15 at one stage before Spain reeled in the deficit with a 9-2 run to ending the opening stanza.Their defence then tightened up in the second quarter, sending back lay-up attempts by Ebzery (ten points, three assists) and Sami Whitcomb (five points) to hold the Opals scoreless for over four minutes.Consecutive three-pointers from Alba Torrens then drew Spain level before the home side moved in front right on the half-time buzzer for their first lead of the game.Ebzery had the response to start the third, scoring the first two baskets including a bail-out shot clock buzzer beater and that sparked an 8-2 run for the Aussies.Spain were not going away though, answering with an 8-1 run themselves and the crowd was delirious when they went into three-quarter time with an eight-point edge.The Opals will now meet the USA for the first time since the 2014 World Cup Semi-Final when the Americans prevailed by 12 points.Winners of the past five World Cup's combined, this is the first time Australia and the USA will meet in a FIBA World Cup gold medal game and both teams enter the contest undefeated.Watch the game live on Fox Sports Australia channel 505 and keep up to date via @basketballaus.The Chemist Warehouse Australian Opals Schedule for the FIBA Women’s World Cup (times AEST):September 22: Australia def.",

        "Allowing myself this acculturation period has actually been very beneficial for me and my long term goals. The new school term began on January 4, and at this time I was ready to introduce two new projects to Saint Paul's Primary School based on what I have observed, and how I felt I could best be of service. The first is in conjunction with the community organization I am paired with, St.Paul's Family Initiative. It is a literacy project that aims to promote family bonding through reading.",
        "Basically I spend a couple of hours each week in the classrooms doing an interactive story hour. Sometimes I read to the students, sometimes they read to me or to each other. I ask question and hold discussion to check for comprehension, and the kids really enjoy the books! I then encourage them to keep reading at home by facilitating library check-outs.",
        "Each week they get a book to take home and read with their parents, and when they bring the books back to class, I give them a chance to tell us about the story. They are always a little shy at first, but the promise of stickers always helps to loosen them up a bit. Yeah I am totally not beyond bribing the kids to read :-). Friends and family back home have even gotten involved with my reading project, and started a MUCH NEEDED book drive!",
        "My Mom and sisters have put their passions (read Panama blog) to great use and have rallied there friends and neighbors to donate old children's books to the students at St.Paul's primary school.

THANKS GUYS!The second project I introduced this month is one that is really near and dear to me, definitely my pet project.",
        "It's an after school girls group, and I feel so strongly about it, that it is difficult for me to articulate why I think it is so important, but I just know that it is. I started this group at two different campuses, with the idea that I could provide these young women with a safe and healthy environment in which to explore issues that are specific to them. Our projects will focus on body image, leadership skills, dating & sex, challenges at home, goal building, health & wellness, etc.",
        "I also set aside time each week for reading or doing homework, trying always to reiterate to the girls the importance of education. So far the group has been very well received, the girls at each campus are really taking ownership of it. At St.Paul's they have chosen to name themselves The Precious Girls Club, and at Newton Ground they are the Girls Friendship Club. Both groups are still in their infancy stages, but I am REALLY REALLY exited to see each them grow.",
        "Here are some photos from this weeks' activities:St.Paul's \"Precious Girls Club,\" fitness hike. The girls and I took a walk to our local beach. Initially I told them no swimming, but come on, you can't take kids to the coast and expect them to stay dry. As soon as they hit the sand, the threw off their uniforms and jumped in. In one photo, you can see me yelling, \"ok, but only 5 minutes!\"Newton Ground Primary \"\"Girls Friendship Club,\" working quietly and productively during homework hour.",

Industry officials say the average advanced coal plant currently emits about 1,800 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour..But, utilities say, laws governing underground disposal were not written with carbon dioxide in mind, and sequestration is in a legal quagmire.Three systems of carbon capture are in various stages of development.",
        "The most common is to convert coal into a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide — which in this context is a fuel, not a pollutant — and carbon dioxide, and to recover the carbon dioxide at two different stages.Another method, demonstrated by the utility American Electric Power in recent years at its Mountaineer plant in West Virginia, is to burn coal conventionally and use an ammonia process to grab the carbon dioxide out of the flue gas.",
        "And if coal is burned in nearly pure oxygen, the flue gases are nearly pure carbon dioxide..The closest to opening is the Southern Company’s Kemper County plant in Mississippi, which will convert coal to gases and then filter out some of the carbon dioxide, reducing emissions by about 65 percent.But the plant, at $5 billion, is $1 billion over budget. Southern Company said in a statement on Friday that the plant’s economics were peculiar to its location, and not a national model.",

        "McCarthy also referred to three projects that would sell carbon dioxide to the oil industry: a coal plant in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, the Boundary Dam project, where the provincial utility plans to rebuild a small 45-year-old unit to capture carbon dioxide; the Texas Clean Energy Project, 15 miles west of Odessa, where the builders hope to soon break ground; and Hydrogen Energy California, proposed for the oil fields of Kern County.As the price of oil has risen, so has the value of carbon dioxide to oil drillers.",
        "The value as a carbon-reduction mechanism is unclear, though, because the result is to produce more oil, all of which will be burned, producing more carbon emissions.E.P.A. officials say that a carbon-emissions rule would push improvements in the technology. Two decades ago when the agency required technology to reduce emissions of a different pollutant — nitrogen oxides, a smog precursor — that, too, was expensive and not thoroughly demonstrated, but today it is routine, they said.The.",
        "The company eventually shut down the effort because it could not recover the costs from its customers. And injection of carbon dioxide into the earth was only possible because it was classified as a research project, he said.Mr. Akins and other industry executives say that a rule governing new coal plants would have little impact because of the low price of natural gas.",
        "“No one in their right mind is going to start a coal unit at this point,” he said.But they fear it will become a precedent for limits on existing plants. Rules on smog, mercury and other pollutants are accelerating the retirement of many old coal plants, and a rule on carbon dioxide would hit many more, they say.Many of the environmental groups that applauded the E.P.A.’s proposed standard appear to agree.",
        "They took pains to note that coal plants also emit a variety of smog-forming and toxic chemicals, and that suppressing new plants because of their carbon dioxide emissions would have the effect of reducing the other emissions, too.On the other side, Senator Mitch McConnell, who is from coal-dependent Kentucky, promised to prevent the measure from being carried out. “The president’s decision today is an escalation of the war on coal,” he said.Article source:"

        "If you want to get funded, don’t ask for “even a dollar.”So you’ve got the next big indie game idea and all you need is a little bit of startup capital to get things going. Like so many other entrepreneurs, artists, and dreamers, you set up a Kickstarter page to raise the necessary funds.But despite the undeniable brilliance of your idea (seriously, it’s just so amazing!) the crowdfunding campaign fails.",
        "What possibly could have gone wrong?According to a new study from the Georgia Institute of Technology, it may have been the words you used in your pitch. Researchers have created a list of phrases and words that appear to be the keys to understanding Kickstarter success.It may not seem like a big deal, but the difference between a phrase like “pledged” and “has pledged” can have major ramifications when it comes to the success of crowdfunding campaigns.",
        "In many cases, it come down to basic principles of persuasion, according to Eric Gilbert, a faculty member at Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing.“Our research revealed that the phrases used in successful Kickstarter campaigns exhibited general persuasion principles,” Gilbert said.",
        "“For example, those campaigns that follow the concept of reciprocity–that is, offer a gift in return for a pledge–and the perceptions of social participation and authority, generated the greatest amount of funding.”Gilbert and his research partner Tanushree Mitra examined 45,000 crowdfunded projects, analyzing 9 million phrases while controlling for 59 other variables known to influence Kickstarter success.",
        "Not only did language make a difference, it was one of the biggest factors contributing to success or failure. The researchers found that 58.56 percent of the variance in successful funding was related to word choice.So what kind of language should you use on Kickstarter? There are several guidelines to keep in mind, said Gilbert and Mitra. The idea that donors will be justly rewarded for their contributions is essential.",
        "Thus phrases like “mention your,” “pledgers will,” and “all supporters,” were found to strongly correlate with successful campaigns. On the flipside, phrases like “volunteers to,” “need one,” and “provide us” have all been linked to unsuccessful campaigns.The study also finds that successful campaigns employ language that fosters a sense of scarcity, which is known create the perception of value.",
        "That’s how researchers account for the success of terms like “given the chance.”The researchers also found that social influence can play a significant role. People are more likely to donate when there is a perception that others in an identified social group are doing the same.“[S]ocial identity theory posits that people identify themselves with a group when they perceive they have attributes in common,” the researchers write in a paper detailing their findings.",
        "“These perceptions can then influence later decisions and choices.”So it comes as no surprise that phrases like “two friends” and “as people” are linked with prosperous fundraising efforts. Even a term like “the Brooklyn”—which is found among the top terms correlating with success—can tap into the strong identity associated with that borough of New York City.But what about the terms associated with failed campaigns? They tend to sound desperate, the researchers found.",
        "The old saying that “everybody likes a winner” is true. Lucrative fundraising campaigns often use language that makes it sound like the project will definitely succeed.",
        "Unsuccessful fundraising efforts on the other hand often use phrases like “need one” and “even a dollar,” which can come off like grovelling.“These phrases highlight the interesting ways in which raw (computer mediated communications) text can expose real world social behaviors,” the authors of the study conclude.Here’s the full list of phrases most closely associated with crowdfunding success and failure:This is not the first time academic researchers have taken an interest in Kickstarter.",

        "You get to make new friends, take part in meet-ups and talk about your car without restraint – and there’s no risk of being left behind at the bar as a result.But some cars – and, indeed, some drivers – demand something special from their car clubs.Here are eight of the greatest membership cards in motoring.Goodwood Road Racing ClubWhile events such as the Breakfast Club meets are open to all, there are plenty of perks to being a member of the Goodwood Road Racing Club, aka the GRRC.For one, there are several incentives built around the Festival of Speed and the Revival, plus there’s exclusive access to the season-opening Members’ Meeting, which sees cars from more recent times take to the famed Goodwood circuit.There are also many exciting opportunities for visits to other motoring locales, as well as access to club track days and events.Ascari ClubRun by Dutch billionaire and championship-winning racing driver Klaas Zwart, the Ascari Race Resort is a bespoke complex of villas set in the heart of rural Malaga.As an added extra, there’s even a fully fledged racing circuit in the back garden!The layout is inspired by Zwart’s favourite circuits and built for the most powerful cars on the planet.",

        "They also receive the benefit of coaching from a variety of Ferrari-contracted professional racing drivers, who make sure they can handle their fire-breathing beasts.Classic Car Club ManhattanDeep in the hustle and bustle of New York, you’ll find Classic Car Club Manhattan.The location certainly plays up to the club element of its name, with a full food menu, happy hour sessions at the bar and even a racing simulator said to be the most sophisticated in the United States.That’s not to say the fleet of cars available to members isn’t the main attraction, though.",
        "Among the modern supercar elite such as the Porsche 911 GT3 and the Aston Martin Vantage, you’ll also find classics such as the BMW M3 E30, the original Acura NSX and its younger sibling, a 1966 Ford GT40 in Gulf colours, as well as a Porsche 550 Spyder.A 3,200 sq ft clubhouse overlooking the Hudson River is currently being built for members.Pure McLarenServing as McLaren’s answer to the Ferrari Corse Clienti package, Pure McLaren is an opportunity for owners to drive their cars in anger on leading race circuits.As well as track sessions for road cars and track monsters like the P1 GTR, the Pure events also host the McLaren-GT Series, which sees drivers go head to head in identical McLaren 570S GT4s.The Pure McLaren package is good for those who don’t want dented egos.",
        "Unlike the Ferrari equivalent, the public aren’t granted entry when McLaren is in town.106 Drivers ClubBefore there was Pure McLaren, there was the McLaren F1 Owners’ Club, operated and founded by racer Ray Bellm, who achieved much of his success behind the wheel of an F1 GTR.In an accidental homage to a small Peugeot, the collective has now been rebranded the 106 Drivers Club, signifying the number of F1 road cars produced and the expected production number of the upcoming Speedtail.With the rebranding, the club has opened itself up to McLaren’s modern Super Series line-up and often organises continental tours for its members.Global Endurance LegendsThe Global Endurance Legends package is run by classic car specialist Jarrah Venables, catering for owners of Le Mans cars from the ’90s through to the early 2010s.The club visits tracks such as Le Mans and Spa and is often at capacity, with the number of cars exceeding 60 on some occasions.With numerous owners of historic racing cars not wanting to take part in proper races, the non-racing format operated by Global Endurance Legends suits many.",
        "As such, the events often see some of the most valuable, significant cars of the era joining the fray rather than sitting dormant in private collections."

Sometimes, however, life requires you to head to a coffee shop where a barista will whip up a nice caffeinated beverage for your enjoyment. Ahhhh, frothy 2%.Of course the problem with these shops, are the pastries. The gluten-laden, deceptively delicious-looking, muffins, scones, donuts, and cakes.",

(Note: Not MY husband. He’s got not a shred of douche-baggery and provides useful pockets for this venture.",

Excused by me, maybe not the owner who worked hard perfecting her hazelnut muffin. Which is why you have to sneak your gluten-free goods. Here’s how.1.",

        "My wife and friends are. I guess the real irony is that now I enjoy it there more, since there’s at least one thing I want to have that I get to have (versus all of the stuff I could have had but never wanted).Where do you live? Because mine doesn’t sell one damn gluten-free thing.We live near Dallas, which–though I think Dallas is not a bad city to live near for some things–I don’t necessarily recommend.I have definitely snuck gluten free foods into numerous places.",

Sometimes it’s blatant (like at an Iranian restaurant in San Diego – I brought warmed kinnickinnick pizza crust in a tupperware container to eat with hummus, since pita is out.) Sometimes it’s more discreet – but scratch that, it’s pretty much always blatant.",
        "If the manager has a problem, I’ll tell them that I will buy gluten free cheerios from them if they sell them, but until then, leave me and my auto-immune disorder alone.I also sneak wine into movie theatres, but that’s a whole different story.You go, gluten-free girl! You might be my new hero.Our *bucks has the kind bars & other chip-y style things. Too bad they only had the orange gluten free cake thing like a day three years ago. BUT the *bucks in Ireland carries GF brownies!",
        "(Though open in their case with the other goodies. ) And ooh I had no idea Glen Ivy had GF bagels. Now I’ll have to justify a trip back to my fave spa just for that! ;)I have been gf for 7 years now, so my memory is a bit faded, but this bakery is near me and I think their croissants are pretty convincing (if you can overlook the shape)Pingback: Gluten-Free Los Angeles: Larchmont Bungalow Before T-Ball | Gluten Is My BitchGod dang, you’re funny.",
        "I was in a *bucks this weekend in Washington State and had to settle for a nut bar snack while my friend gorged on a chicken sausage breakfast pocket thing. I can’t imagine why they wouldn’t develop a few tempting treats for the GF population – everyone else seems to be catching on out here.I know. They’re effing slow at Starbucks.

        "Sometimes, you need someone else to help with your state or federal taxes.",
        "When that happens, you’ll need to fill out a power of attorney form to give them the authority to access your records, tax information, and to act on your behalf.While there are specialized forms that are just for taxes, there are also plenty of cases where you can use a general power of attorney form, or a state-specific tax power of attorney form to do the same thing.These power of attorney forms are different from Federal IRS Form 2848, which is a specialized federal form for tax representatives.",
        "Form 2848 is usually the more powerful option, and a few states only use form 2848. This article is going to focus on the alternatives, but if you’re looking for form 2848, we’ve covered it as well. Or, if you want to read about power of attorney in general, click here.There are lots of reasons you might want to use a state tax power of attorney.",
        "State power of attorney for taxes lets the person you designate access tax documents and may even allow them to file taxes on your behalf.We’ll go more into what kinds of authority a POA will grant in a moment, though.Tax POAs are relatively common, so don’t worry if you realize you need one.",
        "They can be helpful for anyone who knows that they will be very busy during tax season, especially if they might be out of the country on business or holiday.It’s also useful if you have any upcoming medical procedures that might make it more difficult to fill out your tax forms.",
        "It’s important to consider if you have an upcoming surgery or are undergoing long-term treatments that can interfere with day-to-day life like cancer treatment.It’s also common to use a state tax POA if you’re hiring someone else to take care of your taxes.",
        "Some tax professionals will ask for a POA or form 2848 before handling your tax information as an extra layer of protection for both of you.You can also potentially use a tax power of attorney to bring in a tax professional to help if your taxes are audited, or if you have to negotiate terms of repayment on back taxes.",
        "Having a professional on your side can make the whole process much easier, and can help you find the relevant documents to get the best possible deal.You may also want to consider a tax power of attorney if you’re dealing with multiple kinds of taxes, like taxes on your income and taxes on a recent inheritance.",
        "Anytime your taxes are more complicated than usual, it can be helpful to bring in a tax professional or qualified lawyer to help you fill out the forms and make sure you’re receiving the best possible return.There are also several other forms that you may fill out in addition to your POA, but since generalized POA forms are more customizable than other options, you can add a lot of those powers and authorizations on the main form.However, it’s important to make sure you check your state’s law about tax POA.",
        "Some states primarily use federal form 2848, while other states will have their own specialized kinds of tax POA or limitations on the kinds of power that can be granted with a tax POA.One of the main advantages of using a POA form is that you can customize the kinds of authority you’re granting.",
        "You can also potentially use one POA for more than just tax purposes if you would like to make someone your agent or attorney-in-fact for other circumstances as well.Like the specific form needed to be used, you’ll also need to check with your state’s laws to see if they require a tax-specific POA or if you can include other powers on the same form.Depending on the state, you may be able to designate a wide range of tax powers, including but not limited to:All of these powers are subject to local legislation though, so you may not be able to grant all of these powers if your state prohibits it.With a general POA form, you can also customize what powers you are granting.",
        "For instance, your tax professional might not want some of the powers we’ve listed depending on what their professional policies are.Or you can authorize someone to access your tax record and other tax information but not authorize them to sign or file your return on your behalf.",
        "That way they can help you prepare your taxes but can’t file them until you are available to look over the return and sign.In some cases, you might need two different forms for your federal and state taxes, especially if your state is using a state-specific form instead of form 2848 or a generalized POA.",
        "Even if you can use the same forms for both sets of taxes you may have to customize the powers you are granting so that your agent can work on both sets of taxes.That’s because your federal and state tax records are generally kept separate, and you’ll file them separately as well.",
        "Your state may also have a different set of regulations than federal tax regulations and will almost certainly have different tax breaks.Having a tax professional on your side can help you determine what federal tax bracket you are under, as well as your state tax bracket unless you live in a state with a flat income tax.No matter what your circumstances, having a tax POA authorized agent on your side can make tax season a lot less stressful."

        "They clearly state that you need to attribute opinion or disputed facts. That a WP lawyer cleans out vandalism of his page somehow means that liberals bias Wikipedia is not a fact; it is a claim. Jazzman831 11:47, 20 August 2007 (EDT)- Both above make good points, and opened my eyes to a changing of the guard at Wikipedia: a new attorney, described as a liberal, has taken the helm and is restating Wikipedia policy in the New York Times.",
        "He unabashedly edits his own entry and publicly states that anyone else can do likewise. This is a change ... a big one.--Aschlafly 12:25, 20 August 2007 (EDT)- The fact that letting people edit increases bias is so obvious it shouldn't need a citation. Furthermore, this should be noted in the article because it is part of a general pattern, edits by Godwin, Jimbo Wales, Dem HQ, the New York Times. There's a clear pattern here.",
        "SkipJohnson 16:31, 20 August 2007 (EDT)- The sentence in question says that letting people edit increases liberal bias. If this were true, then why is Conservapdia not liberal? It simply is not an obvious fact that open editing makes a liberal bias; there are people at WP all the time who undo liberal bias. And, as I have said three times already, it's not the content I'm objecting to, it's the manner in which it is displayed.",
        "\"This sort of behavior is allowed by liberals, and is a cause of Bias in Wikipedia\" is an opinion and an attack and does not belong in an encyclopedia. And on top of all that, somebody removing vandalism or correcting factual information can not be linked with liberal bias.- I'm fine with finding real reasons as to why liberal bias slips into Wikipedia (well... more accurately I tolerate the idea), but this is not one of those reasons.",
        "Find something that says \"according to X, Y is a cause of liberal bias\". Simply being a liberal editor does not automatically mean there will be liberal edits, let alone liberal bias; we have perfectly functional liberal editors on our own site. Jazzman831 23:05, 20 August 2007 (EDT)- Letting liberals edit their own pages is an obvious cause of bias. Kent Hovind tried to edit his page and he was stopped. So was Jonathan Sarfati. But when someone is a liberal they let them do it.",
        "Of course that makes for more liberal bias. SkipJohnson 11:01, 23 August 2007 (EDT)- You're getting there (I don't see any evidence that Hovind or Sarfati were stopped, but I'll take your word for it for the sake of argument). Letting liberals edit their pages can be an obvious cause of bias, as can be letting conservatives edit pages.",
        "It's not an automatic causation, but a possible tendency (and this doesn't take in to account the mediating effect of having thousands of users who all have different points of view). But this all belongs on the bias in Wikipedia page.",
        "The only thing you have shown me that belongs on this page is that \"Wikipidea\" (meaning, of course, Wikipedians) let their paid staff skirt the rule on self-editing.- The whole crux of the matter involves whether or not Godwin's edits of his own page inserts bias into Wikipedia. Here are every single edit he's made to his own page: [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. That's it, and most of them are minor wording changes; having nothing to do with actual content.",
        "Jazzman831 15:50, 23 August 2007 (EDT)The question on autobiographical editing is mentioned in the conflict of interest page[7]. Michael Godwin is notable enough to have a page, and has been notable long before Wikipedia was created. He is not using it for self promotion (thats where the COI issue comes up), nor are his edits self promotion. If there was to be a conflict of interest on editing a page about ones self, The non-controversial edits covers the examples given by Jazzman.",
        "The first example given (edited in '05) is a link to a page for a forum he hosted and has no information about him (many notable people have hosted many forums, however the forum itself is not notable). One also has to wonder that if this is a critique of Wikipedia, is there a similar problem here with people editing pages about themselves[8]? What is good for the goose is often good for the gander.",
        "--Rutm 16:29, 23 August 2007 (EDT)\"Godwin admits to editing the Wikipedia article about himself\"I'm going to remove that sentence, unless there is a really good reason for keeping it. From what I see, it's in line with Wikipedia's COI policy, others also do it, and even people on this site do it. So the sentence is correct, but pointless. --Jenkins 07:52, 13 January 2008 (EST)"

They shouldn’t be out there.",

        "It’s just too crazy.”Abreau said he noticed some homeowners snow-blowing their driveways while the snow was still falling, which he said wasn’t a particularly good idea.“They’re better off to just wait until it’s over,” he said, to avoid having to do it again after trucks have plowed the streets — which typically results in snow being pushed in front of driveways.As is the case in any major winter storm, Abreau said the DPW now has to get rid of plowed snow piled high on streets.He says most of the snow will be trucked to a site in Raynham owned by G.",

There is another side to teaching, and you discover this very quickly when you get an injury! Allow your clients to do more of the work than you.2.",

When you stop, your students stop.

You are still in the room conducting them like an orchestra, but they are doing all the work. Training is getting people to go from where they are now to where they want to be, and usually it’s in small steps.",
        "You want to start training your students to not stop when you stop and train them to have eyes on you so they get their cues on what to do next.You want to start this in your warm ups first and then move to routines they already know. For example, in a warm up, do they really need to see you demo a step touch? No. So, get them used to doing this on their own. While they are step touching you can go to the back of the room and support people.",
        "Don't do this with brand new routines.IN CONCLUSION...You have to think of your classes as growing a garden. They need daily maintenance—you have to take care of them, be gentle with them, cut them back, give them food and water. In this way, these components are very much like taking care of a garden.It’s very dramatic to go out of the pot into the frying pan. Meaning, There is very little in life where it’s not best practice to take small steps to get fromA to Z!",

        "Contrast of champs makes main event specialSilva's smooth and brash, Henderson's blue-collar tough, but which will win?Dan Henderson is the challenger. If you want to see the picture of a fighter, look at his face. He will wear the marks of his trade through every waking moment of his life. His ears are cauliflowered. He's been hit so many times his nose no longer has the shape God intended and his teeth are a few short of a full set.",
        "There is a scar on his cheek, and his jaw juts out proudly in a way that says, \"Go ahead, hit me if you dare.\"Anderson Silva is the champion. Despite having more than 20 pro fights, his face is almost unblemished. He is flashy in the ring and out. He once wore a mink coat to a UFC event. He is quick to show off the same smile with the same teeth he's had all his life. After finishing off an opponent, he usually dances in the ring.",
        "Sometimes, he does it while there's an opponent in front of him.advertisementSomehow, some way, these two men who couldn't be more different style-wise, will end up in the same place on Saturday night, as the two best middleweights in the world, in the main event of UFC 82 with the title on the line.\"Put simply, this is the best middleweight fight ever,\" UFC President Dana White says.Sometimes, sports promoters and athletes say outrageous things to drum up interest.",
        "This is not one of those times.Silva (20-4) is considered by many to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. Since arriving in the UFC, he has made the middleweight division his playground. He's had five fights, won four by knockout and one by submission. What's alarming about that is that four of those matches were title matches. Against the best competition, he's had his best matches.\"I hope to keep continuing to make history in MMA,\" Silva said through an interpreter.",
        "\"I hope this will be one of the most memorable fights in history.\"If it is, Henderson will also have a hand in it. The California native and former Olympian has been fighting professionally for over a decade, but with most of his career having been overseas, many American fans haven't had the chance to experience his brilliance in the sport.Even in the ring, the styles of champ and challenger clash.",
        "While Silva often utilizes his pinpoint punches and Muay Thai background to deliver punishment in the clinch, Henderson has more of a straight power punching game, while his clinch game centers on the positional and takedown Greco-Roman background that took him to the Olympics. And on the ground, while Silva is a jiu-jitsu fighter, Henderson usually opts for ground and pound.",
        "In short, they couldn't be more different.\"It's going to be an awesome fight,\" said former middleweight champion Evan Tanner, who is returning to UFC after a two-year layoff. \"Silva is going to get a really big challenge from Henderson. I'm not going to call the fight, but it's going to Anderson's toughest fight and I think Henderson has a very good chance of winning.\"Henderson most recently fought at UFC 75, where he took light-heavyweight champion Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson to a five-round decision loss.",
        "Over time, it has been Henderson's willingness to fight all comers that has won him respect in the MMA community. During his career, the natural 185-pounder has taken on fighters from weight classes up to heavyweight. The approach led him to becoming the only man ever to hold belts in two different weight classes in a major organization.",
        "In addition, he holds a win over current UFC interim heavyweight champ Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira on his resume.Now, in his usual weight class, Henderson might be the last UFC middleweight with a legitimate chance to dethrone the champ.\"For me, I get up for the challenges,\" Henderson said. \"He's the top guy and I get up for the big challenges.\"In the lead-up to the fight, Henderson has disagreed with the notion that Silva is the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world.",
        "When asked to expand on his statement, he said, \"I think he hasn't fought me yet, and that's the bottom line. Is he the best? We'll find out on \"Saturday night.\"While the middleweights clearly have the center stage spotlight to themselves, there is a wealth of talent on the card.",
        "Heavyweights Cheick Kongo and Heath Herring have been pushed as the co-main event, but other popular fighters including Andrei Arlovski, Josh Koscheck, Diego Sanchez and Jon Fitch are also competing.In fact, White said that should Fitch defeat Chris Wilson, the former Purdue wrestling star will likely be the first challenger for the welterweight title following the Georges St.",
        "Pierre-Matt Serra rematch.NOTES• White said that UFC is expecting heavyweight Brock Lesnar to fight again this summer, though an exact date and opponent is not yet determined.• Both Andrei Arlovski and Josh Koscheck are on the last fight of their current deals, and White said the he expects to begin negotiating with both quickly. \"Andrei's a guy that I want, so I think we'll get it done,\" he said. \"When I want a guy, I'll get it done.\"Sponsored links"

        "On the back of my last post i’ve been thinking a lot about how I can transform my classroom to better cater for the kids of todays world. To foster and encourage creativity and innovation and have them engaged within a learning environment that breaks away from the norm and gives them a sense of belonging.So after ‘sketch noting’ up a storm, see below ;), i’ve attempted to mockup a learning environment using my current space that reflects 21st Century teaching and learning.",
        "I love the whole notion of learning space and learning space design and love seeing how other educators have their learning spaces set up.Having heard him countless times and even had the opportunity to work alongside him, Stephen Heppell is a person whose ideology around what learning spaces look and feel like are well noted.",
        "His website at contains great information about all things learning space design and i have certainly adopted some of his thinking.Documents such as those shared below via a dropbox folder are also great reads, albeit a little ‘departmentalised’, yet give clear insights into what perhaps an effective learning space can be and or should be. If this is the case though within these documents why are more school classrooms not like this…?",
        "The million dollar question!The TEDx Talk below via Sean Corcorran is a great 17min watch and hearing Sean’s thoughts and philosophies relating to some of the thinking that goes into learning space design is terrific.To cap this post off and on the back of my image below, i simply thought that I would describe my ideal classroom.",
        "Some, if not all, is certainly achievable and time to implement at least some of the below will be the only obstacle!Here we go…“I want a classroom space that belongs to my students. A space that they want to come to because it is safe, exciting and has purpose. Furniture is to be mixed and not all the same to cater for various learners.",
        "Bean bags, collaborative tablespaces, standing height benches, moveable seating, writable surfaces (walls and tables), and isolation, or independent, break out spaces are to be all complemented with natural lighting. I am also a big fan of ‘rooms within rooms’ for student to break away from what is happening in class and to have an environment that lessens interruptions to their learning.",
        "A great example of this is via the work Matt Ives, an educator from New Zealand is doing around Design Thinking, his blog can be located here.I’d also love to have furniture that encourages physical activity, such as having to climb, crawl, or whatever it may be to gain access to a specific space. The examples below I think would be awesome!",
        "I think also having exercise machines such as exercise bikes in the classroom would also be fantastic and I am certain that they’d get used!Here are three older images I located showing just a few of the things I mentions happening at my College.Students, like those who work at Google, are to also have constant access to food and snacks throughout the day. We as adults are not restricted and told when to eat, our students should not be either.",
        "Obviously a focus geared towards healthy eating and brain food will be encouraged and not 500ml Cans of Red Bull!Within the class there is to be a ‘makerspace‘ to foster and encourage student innovation and creativity that is NOT confined to the curriculum being taught. This also will be relevant towards teaching students to code within year levels where it is not stated within the curriculum.",
        "The use of other technologies to drive some of the above (MaKey MaKey, Arduino, iBeacon Tech, etc…) will certainly drive some very powerful learning. The greatest inventors of out time were never restricted to a syllabus!To make the space personal I would like students to share achievements regarding things that they have achieved outside of school. To see their interests and passions that drive who they are and then for them to bring these passions into the classroom.",
        "My classroom would also be shoeless (A Heppell philosophy), to ensure comfort levels are optimum. I would also have no college/school uniform however I think that will be my one major sticking point. 😉 This all relates to the classroom belonging to the students.My classroom would also be technology rich. Students having access to multiple devices, especially with an emphasis on using their own.",
        "I would have charging stations (OH&S, meh…), and a range of other attachments to suit individual learning needs. I would have a mobile LED TV, preferably interactive, that students could airplay, mirror their devices to. I would want this mobile so as to not make it the main point of the room. It would be flexible enough that I could use it with 1, 5, 10, or the whole class. I could turn it so others could not see it so as to not distract.",
        "In saying this it is exactly what I have now, apart from the interactivity, and it is brilliant! Also, and another point I heard off Mr. Heppell, is that I’d love to have ‘Skype’ or ‘Google Hangout’ bars. PLaces where students could interact and connect with others wherever they may be. Why should learning be limited to only the classroom and what is on the internet. Why should students not be able to connect with other experts, no matter where they are!",
        "As the American Educator Will Richardson puts it… “There are approx. 2.5 Billion People online. This can be seen as 2.5 billion predators, or, 2.5 billion teachers… You choose.”Students would have the opportunity to present their work/findings/understandings in ways which play to their strengths and that also encourage a greater global audience.I think that i’ll stop here.",
        "I could perhaps go on but for now, if my classroom was everything that I have just mentioned above, I would be a pretty happy man. I think that my students would be even happier though!"

        "Warm-weather field studies that must be planned months in advance could be delayed or canceled. And studies that rely on strict monitoring or testing schedules could be compromised.Depending on how long the shutdown lasts, the damage could range from inconvenient to irreparable.Scientists with a constant presence on the Farallones since 1968 might have to leave if their agreement with the government isn't renewed by the end of March.",

        "Much of the data is collected during winter, when scientists use planes to observe the wolves forming packs, battling over territory and killing moose, but the team is shut out of the park.The seven-week mission isn't dead yet, but prospects fade daily.The loss of a season's worth of data would be \"devastating,\" said Rolf Peterson of Michigan Technological University, the co-leader. \"Continuity is what's at the core of a lot of observational science, especially long-term projects.",
        "At some point, the loss of continuity degrades the integrity and value of the work itself. And there are things that don't come around a second time.\"The timing is particularly bad because the park recently began a multiyear effort to replenish its wolf population, which had fallen to two. Four were flown to Isle Royale from the mainland last fall — one later died — and researchers planned to relocate several others this winter.",

        "Are you interested in securing a personal loan? Are you ready to move forward, but concerned about choosing the right product from the right lender?With hundreds upon hundreds of personal loan lenders to consider, it’s not always easy to narrow your options and make a final decision.Fortunately, when you know what you’re looking at it’s much easier to proceed with confidence.Here are five details that deserve your attention when searching for a personal loan:1.",
        "Origination FeeYou shouldn’t have to pay money just to secure a personal loan. Search for lenders that don’t charge an origination fee, as this will save you money from the start.An origination fee is a one-time charge calculated as a percentage of the money you’re borrowing. Since some lenders don’t have an origination fee, there’s no good reason to pay one.2.",
        "Interest RateAs an unsecured loan, meaning there is no collateral, a personal loan has a higher interest rate than a secured loan.Rates typically range from 7 to 25 percent, based on your credit score. With an excellent score, you’re in position to secure a rate at the low end of the scale. However, if you have fair credit, your rate will be higher.Tip: find a personal loan with a fixed interest rate, as this locks in your payment over the course of the term.3.",
        "TermA longer term means a smaller monthly payment. It also means you’ll pay out more in interest over the course of the loan.Personal loan terms generally span from 12 to 84 months, giving you a variety of options.Not all lenders give you the option to choose from several terms, so have an idea of what you’re looking for before you begin your search.4.",
        "TimingYou don’t want to spend several days completing an application, a few more waiting for a decision, and a week after that to receive funding.The best lenders have an online system for submitting an application. They also strive to provide an approval within 24 to 48 hours. From there, if you accept the terms and conditions, they can fund your account within one business day.Ask each lender about the timing of the process before you complete an application.5.",
        "ReputationThere’s never a good time to take a risk when borrowing money. You only want to consider personal loan lenders with a stellar reputation.If you’re comfortable with your local bank, ask them for more information on personal loan products.",
        "Also, do your research online to make a list of three to five lenders with a great reputation among borrowers.Final ThoughtsWhile there are other details to consider, focusing on these five things will point you toward the best lender for your personal loan needs. Once you find a lender that suits your requirements, work closely with them to complete an application and finish off the process in a timely and efficient manner."

        "Premature ovarian failure (POF) is when a woman's ovaries stop working before she is 40., though many health care providers suggest taking hormones until age 50. According to the International Premature Ovarian Failure Association, between 1 and 4% of women suffer from POF – equivalent to between 250,000 and 1 million women in the USA alone.A group of researchers have been able to restore ovarian function to rats suffering from POF, which may lead to treating women with POF in the future.",
        "The researchers, led byprofessor Osama Azmy of the National Research Center in Cairo, used embryonic rat stem cells (Mesenchymal stem cells - MSCs) to restore ovary function in the experimental rats. Mesenchyme, or mesenchymal connective tissue, is a type of loose connective tissue, located within the embryo . Cells derived from the mesenchyme are capable of developing into a variety of tissues.They studied 60 mature female rats. The rats were divided into 4 groups.",
        "The first group (group 1) was the control group, which was given no treatment. The rest of the rats, groups 2-4, were given a chemical to induce ovarian failure with 15 rats in each group.Group 2 had ovarian failure, but then was treated with MSC injections. Male Stem cells were used, so that the exact location of the stem cells could subsequently be detected by looking for the presence of a Y chromosome. Group 3 had ovarian failure, and was injected with a saline solution.",
        "Group 4 had ovarian failure and was not treated.The researchers also monitored the levels of FSH (follicle-Stimulating Hormone) and 17β estradiol, to see if hormone levels of the treated rats returned to normal.Within 2 weeks, the rats in the experimental group had regained fully-functioning ovaries. After 8 weeks, the hormone levels of the rats in the treated group (group 2) were the same as those rats which did not have ovarian failure (group 1).",
        "The researchers were able to detect the presence of the MSCs in the ovaries of the rats by confirming the local presence of a Y chromosome.About the results, Azmy said, “This work shows that Mesenchymal Stem Cells can restore ovarian function..”This work is presented at IFFS 2010, which is the World Congress on Fertility and Sterility, Munich 12-16 September.ABSTRACT\"Stem cells restored ovarian function and folliculogenesis in rats following induced Ovarian failure\", Azmy O.M., Taha T.F., Ali A., Atta H.Introduction: Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a heterogenous syndrome affecting 1% of women below the age of 40 years and 0.1% before 30 years.",
        "Infertility is a major problem that affects these women and currently no treatment is available that effectively increases fertility. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising tool for new clinical concepts in supporting cellular therapy.Aim: The aim of this experimental animal study was to explore the therapeutic potency of MSC transplantation for chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage in rats.Materials and methods: This was a prospective case control experimental animal study.",
        "Sixty mature female rats were studied. Fifteen rats served as a control group (group I). 45 rats were injected by intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide (CTX). The study group was subdivided into 3 equal groups (group II, III and IV). Rats of group II were injected intravenously by male MSC, while group III by saline and group IV did not receive any injections. The rats were followed up for eight weeks by daily vaginal smear and biweekly E2 and FSH levels to monitor the ovarian activity.",
        "PCR was done to look for sry gene expression and Y chromosome incorporation into the ovarian tissues. Two rats were sacrificed every 2 weeks for histopathological examination for the ovarian tissues.Results: Ovarian failure was achieved in the study group by two weeks. The hypoestrogenic and hypergonadotropic state was reversed in the group that received MSC injection by the eighth week.",
        "There was no statistical difference between group 1 and 2 after 8 weeks of follow up as regards the mean serum FSH (3.60 ± 0.08 mIU/ mL vs. 5.38 ± 0.31 mIU/mL; P=0.1, respectively) and E2 levels (69.71±1.26 vs. 53.5±0.93 pg/mL, P=0.2; respectively) . Also, cytological and Histopathological examinations showed resurrection of ovarian folliculogenesis and corpus luteum formation in group II and such changes werenot observed in the other groups.",
        "The (sry) gene expression of the Y chromosome was detected within the ovarian tissues in group II.Conclusions: stem cells have the power of recovering ovarian function both in its hormonal and follicular development abilities.",
        "Our work has proved that this principle is achieved mainly by incorporation of stem cells into the ovarian structure and not merely by the paracrine effect.Mesenchymal Stem Cells Shown To Restore Non-Functioning OvariesBy News Staff | September 15th 2010 02:03 PM | 2 comments | Print | E-mail | Track CommentsTwo women, one with premature ovarian failure and one with perimenopause had fetal stem cell transplantation done peripherally.",

        "Last month, we covered what Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is, its symptoms, causes, who is at risk, and how it’s diagnosed. This month, we’ll center our focus on CTS treatment.How is CTS treated? For the best success, treatment should begin as early as possible. Unfortunately, most people wait a long time before they get to the point where the symptoms interfere with daily activity enough to prompt them to make an appointment.",
        "Once the cause or causes of CTS are determined, treatment can address ALL the presenting contributing conditions. The FIRST course of care should be NON-SURGICAL, though this is not always practiced – so be aware! Non-surgical care includes the following:1.",
        "Chiropractic:- Manipulation: This usually includes adjusting the small bones of the hand, the wrist, the forearm, elbow, shoulder, and/or the neck.- Soft-tissue therapy: This includes loosening up the overly tight forearm muscles the median nerve runs through (on the palm side of the forearm).- Modalities: Such as electrical stimulation and/or laser/light therapy can be very beneficial in reducing swelling or inflammation.",
        "In chronic CTS, ultrasound may be helpful as well.- Nutritional: Nutrients such as vitamin B6 have been shown in studies to be effective in some cases. Also, anti-inflammatory herbs (ginger, turmeric, bioflavinoids) and / or digestive enzymes (bromelain, papain, and others) taken between meals are quite effective.2. Anti-Inflammatory: The first important distinction is that ice can be very effective depending on how long the CTS has been present.",
        "In particular, ice cupping or rubbing ice directly on the skin over the carpal tunnel is the most effective way to use ice as an anti-inflammatory agent. When doing so, you will experience four stages of cooling: Cold, Burning, Achy, Numb or “C-BAN.” It’s important to remember this as you are REALLY going to want to quit in the burning/achy stages when it feels uncomfortable.",
        "Once the skin over the wrist / carpal tunnel gets numb (which takes about four to five minutes) QUIT as the next “stage” of cooling is FROST BITE! Most medical practitioners promote the use of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like naproxen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. However, these carry negative side effects including gastritis (burning in the stomach that can lead to ulcers), or liver and/or kidney damage.",
        "Try the nutritional anti-inflammatory approaches FIRST as they are extremely helpful without the negative side effect potential!3. Diet: An ant-inflammatory diet, like the Paleo-diet or gluten free diet, serves as a great tool in reducing the inflammatory markers in the body.",
        "Though only 7-10% of the population has celiac disease (gluten intolerance), it’s been estimated that over 80% of us are gluten “sensitive.” Reducing systemic inflammation can make a BIG DIFFERENCE in the management of many conditions including CTS!4. Mechanical: Wrist “cock-up” splints can also be REALLY HELPFUL, especially for nighttime use.",
        "The reason for this is because when our wrist is bent forwards or backwards, which frequently occurs when sleeping, the pressure inside the carpal tunnel increases, and over time (minutes to hours), the increased pressure in the tunnel exerts compression on the median nerve which then creates numbness into the thumb, index, third and half of the fourth finger, which can wake you up out of a sound sleep.",
        "Keeping the wrist straight at night prevents you from curling your wrist under your jaw while sleeping.5. Ergonomic Modifications: Changing your workstation (computer station, line position, machine controls, pace or rate of repetitive movements, and more) is VERY effective.NOTE: ALL of the above can be managed through the services offered by your doctor of chiropractic!"

        "Lent – ne FausteToday being Ash Wednesday, most of the Christian world is beginning their Lenten season. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Lent is an old Teutonic name for the period 40 days before Easter in preparation for Easter – a sort of time for spiritual reflection and personal purification.",
        "The length of the fast is apparently based on the examples of Moses, Elias (Elijah) and Christ.While fasting is clearly scriptural, Lent itself appears to be more of a spiritual tradition than a New Testament precedent.According to experience and GAMEO, Lent is not a common holiday amongst the Anabaptists of any major branch, being celebrated mostly by acculturated Mennonite congregations in Anglo-American North America.Interestingly, GAMEO does indicate that many German-speaking Anabaptist communities do celebrate Buβ und Bettag or a day of repentance and prayer popular in Germany.",
        "Buβ und Bettag, according to wiki.de (German Wiki) is celebrated roughly eleven days before the first Sunday of Advent on the nearest Wednesday before November 23 (note the similar timing to the United States custom of Thanksgiving Day).",
        "Interestingly, German Wiki also indicates that Buβ und Bettag is based on the scriptural story of Jonah – in Jonah 3: 4-10, we find Jonah convicting the citizens of Nineveh of their sins and immanent destruction by God’s judgment in 40 days unless they repent and are able to convince God to let off.The Bible records that the citizens did repent with fasting and prayer – from the king and his nobles to the common people and the herds of the field.",
        "God heard their repentant prayers and held off His judgment.As for the Russian Mennonites, Lent was always something that involved our non-Mennonite friends, relatives and neighbors but to which we never ourselves had a personal connection.",
        "Herman Rempel includes neither a Plautdietsch word for fasting or Lent in his comprehensive dictionary.I am choosing to take part in the Ash Wednesday, the first official day of Lent and the day after Mardi Gras, as a means of fellowship with my Roman Catholic friends and faith group. But, I have been at a loss as to how to answer the question regarding what I would be giving up for Lent.",
        "Poverty tends to breed virtue as far as vice and self-control are concerned.Amongst the less liturgically minded Protestant churches in the USA, a new tradition seems to be emerging to not celebrate Lent by giving something up but rather by acquiring a new habit – interestingly, the habit does not seem to have a particularly spiritual requirement. But, this is perhaps the route I will take.So for Lent, instead of fasting (Rev.",
        "Reimer seems to find the word fauste suitable), instead of giving up a luxury or a habit for Lent, I will instead re-establish an old one. While I do often study the Bible and many have humorously noted the space my one or many Bibles tend to take up in my computer bag, I have fallen away from a childhood habit of daily devotions. Yet, I often enjoy waking up in the morning and reading several of the morning papers – both on-line and in my usual Luddite way, from the front stoop.",
        "For Lent I will endeavor to reinstitute a morning devotional dwelling not in the New York Times but in the Word and with the Our Daily Bread devotional published by Radio Bible Class – an ancient tradition that is shared at least as far back as my great grandparents on my father’s side and with my mother. I will not take an oath to so perform, but will quietly affirm my intention to do just this.If you care to follow along, I have attached a link to the side of the blog.",

So much so that even if you were standing on the other end of the lot, you could still faintly see it.However, it wasn’t the fishes which caught much of our attention.",
        "Instead, it was the two digit number that was printed next to the fishes, the beautiful number of 1 2 and the two alphabets before them, R M.RM 12/ one full fish woey.!?We could hardly believe our eyes. Well at least, for KL’s price of fishes, that is.Demona: Fatty Tiger was fairly packed, so we proceeded upstairs. Biz looked good for the taukehs here as several tables were occupied upstairs as well.",
        "The menu boasts of a huge range of river rishes, which a frog-under-the-coconut-shell person like myself, wouldn’t know how to differentiate except some obvious difference in shapes and sizes between the several few.Some fishes had golden bar price tags, potentially costing a mere fish head alone to be several hundred bucks (WOW!)We hunted for the RM12/fish but couldn’t spot it on the menu. The waitress came up and explained to us that there was such a fish at such a price.",
        "These particular riverfishes are reared by the taukeh and sold at a real good deal price, and they do not make much profit out of this. Instead, their profit targets are more on the higher end river rishes eg: the golden price tag fishes.Demona: Poor RM 12 river fish, you. Fed to the right size, and scooped right out of its pond and in it went, into a pack of ice, waiting to be served fresh to the next customer…… US.Demona: Sorry, fishy fish. You were the chosen one to serve us.",

We had this fish, cooked plain steamed before, and my gf who joined in the dinner mentioned that there was a slight muddy taste to it but thankfully, wasn’t obvious enough to put you off eating it further.",
        "With the assam nyonya paste, the mud taste was of course, covered.Anyhow, in usual circumstances, almost all self reared riverfishes couldn’t run too far from having the distinct muddy taste to their meat as they have less room to freely swim about, unlike their wild river fish brothers.Demona: Dogma ordered a Dried Chillis Fried Chicken rice to eat along with the fish. The chicken meat was quite tender, with a nice fragrant aroma of ginger, onions and dried chillies absorbed into the meat. Deliciouso!",
        "As for me, the usual rice skipper…. I also stole half of Dogma’s chicken slices away. Grrrrrrrrrr.I’m guessing the owner will shake his head whenever he sees people like us coming in, as we chose the cheapes fish, and ate the least (some more share meal!).",
        "If there are more of us diners coming in, the restaurant’s profit margin’s going to decline drastically.On the contrary, the owner came up to us instead, with a big sincere smile, explaining to us about the fish which we ate, as well as the other fishes that he was selling, and even brought those expensive dead fishes on a tray, just to show us.",
        "He did subtly mentioned that the profit earnings for the RM12/fish was not much but that did not affect him severely as this strategy also earned him more happy return customers who potentially have golden goose pockets, and willing to explore more than just the RM12/fish deal.This is one restaurant that we shall always come to whenever we feel like having good olde’ fish meat to eat and not having to burn our wallets too much."

        "Finding the perfect house is so difficult–especially when there are so few homes on the market in STP. Maybe we will end up looking at some of the same houses?? I cannot image moving this 2 kids–it is difficult enough as is with 2 adults. Hopefully it isn’t too painful for you. I’m glad you found our site! I will definitely check out your blog. I haven’t come across too many other St. Paulians blogging about their home renos and stuff. Consider yourself followed!"

        "Hello myfitspirationers!! If most of you follow me on twitter (in case you don’t, join the party @BL11Hannah), you will know that I recently researched the HCG diet after watching a friend inject herself with the hormone on a lunch date with my gal pals. I was confused, thinking “Since when do you have diabetes?” Her explanation came after I was told that the injection was HCG known as Human Chorionic Gonadotropin.",
        "HCG is a hormone found in the urine during pregnancy that is the latest weight loss quick fix craze. In theory, the HCG hormone is supposed to suppress hunger and trigger your body’s use of fat for fuel. Which is what BootCamp does for me ;)!! I recently read that the hormone is now coming from female horse urine. Is that something you are comfortable injecting yourself with or putting underneath your tonque? If so, I would just stop reading now!",
        "😉Believe me when I say, I am no stranger to quick fix diets! If you know me on a personal level, you will know that I am obsessed, that’s rightOBSESSED with infomercials! I was the first human to ever buy Oxyclean. Olivia calls my spare bedroom the exercise graveyard where made-for-TV exercise equipment go to die. To name a few….The Ab Circle Pro, The Ab Glider, Brazil Butt Lift (still have high hopes for that one), Food Lovers Fat Loss System, The Ab Dolly, Electro Muscle Stimulator…Need I go on?",
        "If you’re like I WAS, I bought into everything. I was so desperate to lose the weight quickly that I watched tons of money circle the drain as my diet dreams of success fell further and further from reality. Why did I ever think it was ok to eat Velveeta Cheese AKA: Liquid Gold for breakfast wrapped in bacon and lose weight? Hello low carb and lovin it! Eeek, so many diets so little time. Yet, I still managed to get close to 300 lbs.",
        "When I stepped on the ranch of the Biggest Loser, or should I say, when Olivia dragged me by my hair kicking and screaming, I was just waiting for production to give us a blue speckled pill (you know what I’m talkin about) a shot or lightening fat zapper.",
        "How else do those people lose so many pounds in a week?Then came the first workout.Jillian Michaels perched on my treadmill and announced to the ranch team “You’re gonna move more and eat less, the quality of your food is going to out-weigh the quantity and you will literally heal your sick bodies with food”. Excuse me? Did I sign up for this? This sounds like my Weight Watchers hell! Even though I think WW is one of the best plans out there, I didn’t want to do it again!",
        "Flashes of “Congrats, you lost a quarter of a lb this week” ran through my mind. Then Olivia pulled me aside and said “Have we really given our bodies a chance to heal through diet and exercise?”Well…..um…..errrrrr….I’ve tried everything, right? WRONG. I had never really trusted my body for a SIGNIFICANT length of time to truly operate the way it was created to, without all of this excess weight! So I committed to the old fashioned way and low and behold it worked!",
        "My body began processing chemical free food, I had energy, my mood was better (except when Olivia made me wake up early) and miracles happened! My oily skin and hair became dryer, my skin clearer, I even had less hair on my legs to shave. Ridding my body of excess hormones by eating organic, pesticide and chemical free changed everything. I didn’t even miss my infomercials because for once I was starting to break the cycle.",
        "That’s when I became one of those people I loathed in the past who preached “Lifestyle” and guess what? I got one! My very own lifestyle!Does doing things this way take more time? Yes. More effort? Yes.BUT….It will get you off the yo-yo diet train for life. Food and exercise and A LOT of prayer, healed my body from the inside out. I learned discipline, worked on my confidence and was finally able to de-cloud my mind of this Quick-Fix syndrome that I had been oh so accustomed to!",
        "My blood pressure stabled, I became fertile, and I began to see life in a different way. Healthy can be a state of mind but it is also a walk. Sometimes you fall, sometimes you don’t, but the point is, you keep walking! I started researching long term effects of fad diets. Heart attacks, high blood pressure, cancer, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, starvation, vital organ shut downs, and so many more. So ask yourself, is this really worth it in the LONG RUN?",
        "We all know there is no “Quick” way to make money! So why would you think the same about your body? Why would you treat yourself this way and for what? So I challenge you to quit the quick fix (say that 10 times fast). Lay down the diets, and get yourself a lifestyle! After all, you’re worth it and so are those higher priced groceries. We spend so much $$ on our homes and cars, why wouldn’t you on your body? This blog is for EVERY person out there who has tried the quick fix and failed. NO MORE!",
        "You deserve better and so do your children’s children. Trust me, you will thank me later!! If anyone is trying to figure out how to wrap velveeta cheese in bacon without it melting, it can’t be done, I’ve tried. Step AWAY from the yellow box!!Now, below in the comments, I want to hear the fad diets you’ve tried and did they work??? Don’t be shy, Let’s hear it!!!"

        "That for many victims of Alzheimer's is an active part of their disease progression.Your mother-in-law has no memory of the death of a family member, and when the thought occurs to her that she hasn't seen her mother, brother or spouse lately, she has no recall of their death, and for her is simply asking a logical question \"“ over and over and over.",

        "However, you will not eliminate the repetition of those questions because that is part of the disease.I don't agree with the previous answer. Why would you want to lie to someone? Just because their memories are declining doesn't mean you have to treat them like an idiot or a child and degrade their dignity further. Just tell them the truth.

        "- This is a guest blog post by Bonnie Joy Dewkett about Time Management Tips for Businesses -Small business owners are often responsible for lots of things; administrative work, marketing efforts and management of the company. It’s a lot to handle and a lot of things to get done each day. Often, business owners end up focusing on all of the small details and the big projects and development work goes undone.",
        "By really determining where and how you spend your time, you can make sure you are making the best of it. By maximizing your time, you are making your life less stressful and allowing your business to grow.1# Write everything down. Getting things out of your head and into a productivity app is helpful in reducing mind clutter. Something as simple as free note taking program can be divided into different sections and easily carried around with you.2# Keep lists, and have more than one.",
        "A productivity app works great for this..3#.4# Determine how you prioritize. Some people like to do what is most difficult first in their day. Others want to do what could make them the most money first in the day. Pick a way to prioritize and stick with it.5# Schedule time for email as the Internet can be a huge time waster..6# Delegate everything you can. If you have an assistant, and you are doing your own filing, that’s not an effective use of your time.",
        "Find out what can be done by others and pass it off to them. A little time training someone goes a long way in freeing up your day.7# Schedule time for making proactive phone calls, and returning calls you’ve received. Playing phone tag can use up a lot of time and can decrease your productivity. Schedule telephone calls with your other party so that you both know when you will be available to chat.",
        "Bundle your phone calls all at once so that you are not being disrupted from your work more than one time.8# Go to meetings or make phone calls with an agenda and questions. Know what you WANT and NEED to accomplish during your call or meeting. Having no schedule or agenda allows other topics to creep in, wasting your valuable time.9# location, even if it is just within your office.10# Prepare for tomorrow today.",
        "By cleaning off your desk today, and making a list of things you should accomplish first thing tomorrow, you allow yourself to have focus when you first arrive at the office the next day. We are often foggy in the morning, which makes us unsure of where to begin working for the day. When you don’t know where to begin, you delay the entire day.",
        "Writing your to-do list before you leave for the day also clears your mind so that you can rest, relax, and get a good night’s sleep when you get home.Running a small business is always challenging! There are never enough resources: time, space, and money in particular. Learning to maximize what you have is important, and can mean the difference between success and failure. Often, we simply need to change the way we are looking at things and how we are managing our time.",
        "By freeing up time, we can focus on things that are important to the success of the business, such as social media marketing. While social media marketing does not cost anything to use, the time invested must come from somewhere. By learning how to “create” time in our already busy days, you can add in social media marketing to your day and grow the success of your company.About Bonnie:Bonnie Joy Dewkett, is a co-founder of Social Ocean Media.",

        "Four years ago, Tunisia and the Egypt erupted in broad popular revolts. At first, analysts, Arab and Westerners alike, were confounded.",
        "When Libya, Bahrain, Yemen, and Syria followed, in short order, the upheavals came to be described as the “Arab Spring”—the assumption being that what was occurring in the Middle East would unfold in a manner reminiscent of the rapid transformations that took place in Eastern and Central Europe following the collapse of the Soviet Union.The model envisioned by the term the “Arab Spring” was relatively straightforward.",
        "A spark had been ignited in Tunisia that would catch fire across the region bringing fundamental social and political transformation in its wake. It was a simple linear trajectory from dictatorship to democracy. Many experts were certain that this would be the way the Arab Spring would progress.However, when Zogby Research Services (ZRS) polled in Arab countries in late 2011 we found that public opinion was less certain.",
        "For example, when we asked citizens in Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and UAE, whether they believed the Middle East was better off or worse off as a result of the Arab Spring the responses were largely divided between those who said that, to see what the Arab public now felt about the “Arab Spring”. What we found was that the mood has; Yemen is not Syria or Libya; and Bahrain is none of the above.).",
        "While reviews of Yemen’s path were somewhat mixed, we noted that the poll was completed before Houthi allied forces overran Sana’a bringing new uncertainty to that country. Libya was judged to be significantly worse off than before the Arab Spring began. effected countries. In our poll, we found that respondents demonstrated little support for the role of Brotherhood in their own country, but there was an acknowledgment of the positive role that the group had played in Tunisia.",
        "The Brotherhood received mixed reviews for its role in Egypt. A most revealing result was the near even positive/negative assessment (43%/44%) that Egyptians gave to the Brotherhood’s impact on developments in their country. This finding, which will likely be rejected by some, matches the results found by other polling companies and continues the upward climb in the Brotherhood’s ratings in polls we have conducted in Egypt in the last two years.",
        "It doesn’t necessarily translate to a measure of the group’s popularity as it does to a growing uneasiness with the current trajectory of developments in Egypt.",
        "Evidence of this unease can be found in responses we received when we found Egyptians divided as to whether the situation in their country had become better or worse since the beginning of the Arab Spring—30% said “better” and 29% said “worse”.In addition to the unraveling of the Arab Spring and the role of the Muslim Brotherhood, other factors we explored in our survey were regional views of the bloody conflict in Syria, the emergence of ISIL, and the growth of the twin cancers of radicalizationizing sect-based entities.",
        "There was no confidence that this conflict would end soon or that way might be found to achieve a negotiated solution to resolve it. In every country but Lebanon, there was rejection of the Assad regime.There is near universal rejection of ISIL and deep concern about the impact that this movement was having on the region.",
        "At the same time, the lack of confidence in the US that we found in our June, 2014 poll and the low favorable ratings Arabs give to US involvement in the region combine to create less than enthusiastic support for a Western-led effort to confront ISIL. In fact, only in Egypt and Iraq were slight majorities in favor of a role for the West in this conflict. In Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and UAE majorities were opposed.."

        "For this week’s “Fan Friday”, our season finale, I’m proud to be able to feature one of our most dedicated & loyal readers. From Chuck’s post on the “Red’s Army.com Hall of Fame“:.Jester started reading Red’s Army while stationed as a Combat Medic & Staff Sergeant with the 463rd Engineer Battalion of the US Army in Balad, Iraq. It was 2005, and the C’s were in the second year of Doc Rivers’ tenure.",
        "Folks like Jester and Tim(FireDoc) could be found ranting and/or raving in the comments section of every post. Jester tells me that the main thing that got him hooked on the site was the no BS approach of founders John & Chuck. They spoke to and for the average Celtics fan, and like Jester, they loved a stiff drink.",
        "As the years went on, and Red’s Army began hosting live call-in style shows, Jester would dial them up and introduce himself with his trademark “Good Morning..”-even if it was 10pm on the east coast. Jester’s been here through it all-the ups & downs of the Celtics, a guy starting an entire blog devoted to how much our site sucked and even some of the live chats that we ran:Jester has also been known to play the occasional joke or two hence the moniker “Jester”.",
        "Like the time he called into “Celtics Talk Radio” and impersonated me. When I actually called in for my guest appearance, I had no idea what was going on, and the show’s host found out that he had been talking to a KWAPT impersonator. Nice one Jester:Jester grew up in Bridgeport, Ohio. Coincidentally, Bridgeport is also the hometown of one of the greatest Celtics of all-time, John “Hondo” Havlicek.",
        "Jester has fond memories of watching some of the glory days of Celtics basketball with his father, who was also a big fan. Once a young Jester saw the passion & love that his dad had for the boys from Beantown, he quickly drank the green Kool-Aid himself. He lists Larry Bird’s amazing triple-double against the Blazers in 1992 as the most enjoyable game he and his dad watched together. Bird went off for 49 points, 14 rebounds & 12 assists in Boston’s 152-148 double OT win.",
        "It was a duel for the ages, as Portland’s Clyde Drexler (41 pts) and Larry Legend went back & forth hitting one big shot after another.Jester attended Ohio University Eastern in St. Clairsville, Ohio. He played on the men’s bball team all four years of his stay, and rocked “00” in honor of the great Robert Parish. Despite being a big fan of “The Chief”, Jester says that his all-time fave Celt is Kevin McHale.",
        "As for this year’s team, he really likes the nucleus of Rondo, Sully & Avery Bradley. He also likes a lot of what he’s seen from young Kelly Olynyk. We are both in complete agreement that Olynyk needs some muscle. Once he hits those weights, he should do much better against the bigger, stronger guys that he’s encountered over his rookie season in the NBA.Jester and I wrapped-up our discussion by talking about the future of this team. He feels that this will be a rather quick rebuild.",
        "He does not envision Danny & Wyc taking a very long time to bring some talent into town. But in the meantime, he says that if he could get through the 2006-07 disaster, he can get through anything. And I agree. Jester is what you call a die-hard. That term is thrown around quite a bit nowadays, but in his case, it could even be an understatement.",
        "This guy absolutely loves the Boston Celtics and will be supporting them until the day that he dies.I want to send a huge thank you out to Jester for participating in Fan Friday, and also for his unwavering support of Red’s Army for the past 9+ years. You can follow him on Twitter via this link, and he’s always posting his opinions, thoughts & sometimes unintelligible drunken banter in our comments section. Welp, this is it-another year of “Fan Friday” over.",
        "Thank you all so much for reading, and GO CELTICS. Have a great spring/summer everyone! -KWAPT"

        "Last week we started introducing you to the basics of color theory with some definitions to help you understand more in-depth principles. These definitions will help you as we introduce new lessons in the coming weeks. Today, I wanted to introduce you to some basic color schemes that might inspire a new combination within your stash. Color schemes combine colors to create an aesthetic that will more often than not look appealing together.",
        "Some color schemes are simply two colors, while some involve several colors. No matter the color scheme you choose, they’re a great starting point for trying new combinations.A few classic color schemes are:ANALOGOUSAnalogous colors are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. Examples include: green, yellow-green, and yellow & red, red orange, and orange. These color combinations are often found in nature which has a tendency to make it more pleasing to the human eye.",
        "When utilizing an analogous color scheme, it’s a good idea to focus on one hue as the focal color.Kits that (for the most part) use an analogous color scheme:MONOCHROMATICA monochromatic color scheme incorporates different values (or tints and shades) of the same color. While lacking the diversity of multiple hues, it can still be very effective.",
        "The different values of the color are often times paired with a white or neutral color to extend the “longevity” so to speak, of the color scheme.Kits that (for the most part) use a monochromatic color scheme:COMPLEMENTARYOpposites attract! Complementary colors are those that are opposite each other on the color wheel (e.g. blue and orange, red and green, purple and yellow). They create high contrast and can be very dramatic.",
        "If you’re looking for a similar effect without all of the drama, try pairing a less saturated color (e.g. blue) with its vibrant counterpart (in this case, orange). By doing this you can tone down the intensity, while still utilizing the effect of the complementary color scheme.Kits that (for the most part) use a complementary color scheme:Keep in mind that there is no reason why you have to follow any sort of rule. These color schemes are just a good place for you to start from.",
        "Understanding why certain colors react well with others will help you out the next time you’re looking for that one special color.Now it’s time to create your own color scheme! Using what you already know, go ahead and start making some new combinations. For a bigger challenge, start with a color you never use or aren’t particularly fond of. Knowing how to create a harmonious match might allow you to appreciate it more.If you’re looking for color inspiration, there’s no need to go too far.",
        "Between being inspired by things in nature, and great sources of inspiration right at your fingertips via Pinterest.com and Design-Seeds.com, you’re sure to find plenty of colors to keep you inspired and busy. If you’re looking for a place to compare/contrast fabrics, check out our design table! Swatch buddies will come in handy if you are trying to match a fabric in your stash while on the go."

        "Massage During PregnancyMany expectant mums will find it very difficult to lie on the stomach for any period of time by the fourth month of pregnancy. And, generally, it isn’t a wise idea to lay flat on your back during the latter part as this may make you feel light headed and the weight of the foetus can restrict the circulation and cause a tingling sensation in the legs.",
        "With the proper position and a well-trained therapist, a massage is useful for the following reasons:- Massaging the legs counteract the effects of oedema, varicose veins and tiredness. The legs and the arms may be treated with your body in a semi-supine position or sitting in a comfortable chair.- You can be seated, leading forward with cushions for support to have you back massaged.- For a variety of ethical reasons, however, massaging the abdomen is not a good idea.",

        "Real time Rome from MIT SENSEable City Lab, 2006What does the MESH in MESH Cities stand for? We've answered that question for the editors of Spacing Magazine in a short essay for spacingtoronto.ca. It is published today. Here is how it is explained:Whatever you might think about a computer-driven modernity, MESH Cities are not just smart cities. MESH Cities go beyond the management of infrastructure to the heart of what makes cities worthwhile—their livability.",
        "Metaphorically, MESH Cities are the offspring of an improbable marriage between Jane Jacobs and ubiquitous city computing. Their kids, in this context, are named MESH: M=Mobile, E=Efficient, S=Subtle, H=HeuristicsThe term is one our editor, Robert Ouellette, coined, but it is influenced by researchers and practitioners going back to Teilhard de Chardin's ideas about the Noosphere, Buckminster Fuller's synergetics, and many, many others.",
        "We would also like to thank our colleagues at Toronto's Mesh Conference for their exploration of all topics related to how the Net changes things.Here is a further elaboration of the acronym:MOBILE: Mobile devices and the networks that support them are the essential ingredient to the mix. They provide the bottom-up, real-time information conduit that informs us what is right or wrong about our city.",
        "MIT's SENSEable City Lab graph of the real-time use of mobile devices in Rome for the 2006 Venice Biennale seen above illustrates how much information is being generated at a given moment.. Any system adopted by city administrators must not overwhelm city users. In fact, the more invisible and non-intrusive a system is the better it will serve its.",
        "This is the major reason why there has been an exponential shift in the speed of city design, especially in emerging economies where existing infrastructure does not get in the way. What are your thoughts on MESH Cities? Let us know."

        "Notre Dame Spring Game: 5 Things to Watch for at Saturday's GameApril 17, 2012Soon, Notre Dame and the Fighting Irish fans will enjoy the anticipated Blue and Gold game. Unlike years past, this spring game has many important things to watch for, rather than just offering a preview of the depth chart.",
        "Players will actually be competing for multiple positions, none more important than at quarterback.The QB BattleAlthough the decision of who will be starting quarterback will not be determined from the Blue and Gold game, it will be the first time the public will see Everett Golson, Andrew Hendrix, Tommy Rees and touted recruit Gunner Kiel compete so closely.With Rees being the incumbent and likely one of the starters for the game, he will be attempting to help silence his critics with a strong performance.",
        "While he does this, the other three quarterbacks will be making their case as to why they should dethrone Rees and take the reins as Notre Dame's leader on offense.Newcomer Gunner Kiel has had hype surround his name ever since his roller coaster type of recruiting process, shunning Indiana and LSU to join the Fighting Irish.",
        "If Gunner plays significant minutes, we may see what exactly the future of Notre Dame has in store.While he should not be expected to blow away critics, it will be a good chance to see how he has progressed this spring. Learning the playbook, creating chemistry and reading a collegiate-level defense are all abilities that will be in question for Kiel during the Blue and Gold game.John GoodmanBrian Kelly continues to praise fifth-year receiver John Goodman.",
        "Will John finally put it all together in his final year and become a key contributor?With the speed and talent Goodman possesses, he has been a major disappointment in terms of production. Throughout his career, he has only accumulated 315 yards on 28 receptions.Last year, we saw a similar situation with Deion Walker. Brian Kelly often stated his value and impressive play during spring, but Deion never lived up to expectations.",
        "There is one major difference between the two situations, however.This year, the Notre Dame receiving corps lacks experience. While DaVaris Daniels will be trying to physically fill the void of NFL-bound Michael Floyd, he lacks the experience from a leadership stand point.",
        "Goodman brings by far the most experience to the table.The Blue and Gold game will give fans a preview of whether Goodman will become more than just a star at practice, but a threat on the field during the season as well.Replacing Aaron LynchIt is no surprise to say that losing Aaron Lynch was a blow dealt to the Irish's defense.",
        "Outside of Manti Te'o, Lynch was Notre Dame's most talented and exciting defensive player.Replacing Lynch will not be possible in terms of talent, but Kapron Lewis-Moore is a solid player and will serve in place of Lynch to start at the Blue and Gold game. On the heels of Kapron, will be recruit Sheldon Day. Sheldon barely cracks the ESPNU 150 at No.",
        "143 and may offer more talent in the long-term replacement to Aaron Lynch, compared to Lewis-Moore.It will be interesting to see how Sheldon plays come April 21, and what type of pass-rush he can create with his 6'2\" and 286-pound frame. Throughout the year, Sheldon will continue to add good bulk and continue to work on his ability to rip past linemen and often play smaller than he is.The Blue and Gold game will be the first glimpse of life without the very talented Lynch.",
        "Whether we come to find a new replacement is better than expected, or the loss will continue to haunt the defense, the spring game will be the first tell.DaVaris Daniels' Best Michael Floyd ImpersonationAlthough every player creates his own legacy and image, every Notre Dame fan is hoping to see DaVaris Daniels recreate Michael Floyd.With Michael Floyd entering the NFL draft, Notre Dame lost one of the best receivers in the nation.",
        "To start the year, DaVaris is the one tasked to replace him in the depth chart as the playmaker and deep threat.With every play during the Blue and Gold game that involves Daniels lined up on the outside, the Irish faithful will be anticipating a deep throw and spectacular catch we have seen Floyd make time and again.It may be unfair to ask such a daunting task of Daniels, but his physical attributes and abilities almost mirror that of Floyd.",
        "DaVaris' strong points include his long stride but quickness with the ball, his arm length and leaping ability during jump balls, running clean routes and using his big hands to pluck and tuck the ball.Sounds very familiar to Michael's style of play, and the Blue and Gold game may have a few athletic plays in store for us from the exciting Daniels.The Tight End PairWhen Kyle Rudolph entered the draft, Notre Dame was left with a void at the tight end position.",
        "Until Tyler Eifort exploded for an amazing season with 63 receptions and 803 yards—both tight end records at Notre Dame.Linebacker Troy Niklas has been officially moved to tight end, and is expected to mainly perform at the position as a blocker.",
        "Using his 6'6\" frame and 250-pound body, Niklas also has the speed and agility to fill the void of blocking downfield as Michael Floyd did.This move is allowed since Notre Dame has very good depth at the outside linebacker position, and it enables Tyler Eifert to move throughout the Fighting Irish offense.What is there to watch for at the Blue and Gold game, though?",
        "Niklas' hands and route running.Since Niklas is a physical specimen, he could become another threat in the great line of Notre Dame tight ends if he were to learn the nuances of route running and display good catching abilities.The question surrounding Tyler Eifert has more to do more with the receiving corps rather than himself.",
        "The receivers need to perform at a high enough level to enable Eifert to remain from being singled out.The Blue and Gold game will not answer questions indefinitely, act as a crystal ball to see into the future and reveal Notre Dame's fate or end the crucial quarterback battle, but it will give Notre Dame fans a glimpse as to what to expect from another hyped Notre Dame team.Follow me on twitter @mitchcharette"

He won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for this book. He has also written for Star Trek, Sliders, Babylon 5, and The Twilight Zone.",
        "His other novels include The Man Who Folded Himself and When HARLIE Was One.The Martian Child, novel is semi-autobiographical. The movie has taken licence and the characters are not the same as in the movie, but they are just as interesting, still capturing your heart.I don't know which is better, the book or the movie. John Cusack and Bobby Coleman have a wonderful chemistry as father and son. On the other hand, Gerrold's writing is lyrical and really captures the imagination.",
        "I guess I'd have to say that this is the case where you want to read the book and watch the movie...even if they are somewhat different."

The assets of Success Co. include a number of appreciated assets, such as investments in stocks, land and buildings. Also, many assets subject to depreciation — mostly equipment — are on the books for much less than their current value.Now suppose that Success Co. is correctly valued (for tax purposes) at $5 million.",

        "I like beat-em-ups a lot, and one of my favorites from the SNES-era is Capcom’s The King of Dragons. Originally an arcade hack and slash adventure, it was ported to the SNES in 1994. I played through it yesterday on a whim, and it brought all kinds of nostalgia for the 90s rushing back. It has 16 levels of sword-swinging, orc-slaying, magic-blasting adventure as our heroes journey forth to defeat the Red Dragon Gildiss and save the Kingdom of Malus from his tyranny.",
        "You can slay the dragon (or die in the attempt) in less than an hour. There’s something really charming about the ultra-brief, ultra-breakneck pace of old 16-bit games, and it’s a huge part of why I love this game.The King of Dragons was an early score by Yoko Shimomura, who’s now known for her work in the Kingdom Hearts and Paper Mario series. Her work on this game really sets the tone for the adventure. It’s not her best work, and she’s limited somewhat by the SNES’ crude audio CPU.",
        "But despite that, the music in this game is especially catchy. Here’s a representative sample:This is your basic hack-n-slash arcade adventure. You move through stages, you mash the attack button. There’s a lot of strategy in how you approach enemies or position yourself on the screen, but the core gameplay is very basic and intuitive.",
        "You don’t need to memorize advanced techniques to succeed in The King of Dragons, meaning anyone can jump right in and see what it has to offer.The setting is a classic D&D-style fantasy adventure. You’ve got humans, dwarves, elves, orcs, and dragons, just to name a few. Essential classes like fighter, cleric, and wizard are present and accounted for. It’s not the most original thing in the world, but it feels familiar, like a comfy pair of shoes.",
        "I’m definitely at home playing an axe-swinging goblin slaying orcs and lizardfolk left and right. The locations are vibrant and varied, from crumbling towers to enchanted forests to underground dungeons. There’s nothing groundbreaking here, but the level of polish and care that went into the art design comes off very well.One thing that sets this game apart from its contemporaries is a level-up system. Points aren’t pointless here.",
        "At set score thresholds your character gains levels, increasing their max hit points. You also pick up weapon and equipment upgrades throughout the game that increase your attack power, defense, shield recovery speed, or attack speed depending on the character. It’s a very simple advancement system, but each upgrade feels satisfying and meaningful, serving as an incentive to keep playing.The difficulty is the perfect sweet spot.",
        "It’s a pretty tricky game, but every enemy has their exploitable foibles that makes them trivial with practice. Seeing the ending of The King of Dragons isn’t all that hard, but you’ll probably need to pick up some extra continues. The caveat is that you should basically always play as Fighter or Cleric. The other three classes are interesting, but have extreme drawbacks.",
        "Wizard and Elf lack a shield and are extremely squishy, and Dwarf is short and levels up slowly.Great co-op games are hard to find, and The King of Dragons is one of them. It’s from the golden age of co-op beat-em-ups like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Golden Axe, Final Fight, and Streets of Rage. While the arcade version features three-player simultaneous co-op, you’ll have to make do with two on the SNES. Still, it’s a lot better than stupid Maximum Carnage, with its single-player nonsense.",
        "If you’re looking for a rad old game to play through with a friend, possibly while drinking, then look no further than this gem.There’s a lot to recommend The King of Dragons, but also some interesting limitations. Most fans of the genre have probably played the seminal Golden Axe, and you might expect The King of Dragons to be similar, given that they’re both about weapon-wielding, well-muscled heroes fighting fantasy monsters. But they feel almost completely different.",
        "Golden Axe has lots of jumping around from platform to platform, as well as a rather deep combat system. The King of Dragons, on the other hand, is about as simple as it gets. You don’t have combos or even a run function. The only options are a single attack, a block, an awkward jump, and a magic spell (at the cost of some health).So does that mean the game lacks variety? Absolutely not. The combat, despite being simple and a bit repetitive, is actually incredibly varied.",
        "With five characters to choose from, each of which feels unique, there’s a lot of replay value. You can get up close and personal with the Fighter, Cleric, and Dwarf, or you can go for range with the Elf and Wizard. Honestly, the Elf and Wizard kind of suck since they can’t block, but they add fun variety all the same, especially when playing co-op.Having such a limited moveset might feel restrictive in a lesser game, but in this one it only serves to focus you on the action.",
        "What’s more, each of the 16 stages has a boss, most of which are unique and require careful strategy to bring down. You have to decide where to stand, when to block, when to jump, and when to swing your sword like there’s no tomorrow.The SNES generation is my favorite era of gaming (which might explain why I write about it so much), and a big part of that is all the great brawl/hack-n-slash games.",
        "It’s easy to jump in and jump out of a game like this, knowing that you can breeze through the early stages in a flash. Game over? No biggie. Have to stop and go to work? Not a problem. With a game like The King of Dragons, it’s not so much about reaching the endgame as enjoying the ride along the way. It’s about as simple a premise as you can have for a game, but the execution is so satisfying and polished that I can guarantee you’re going to have a fun time.So is the elf a lady or a man?",
        "I’m getting mixed signals from different artwork.It’s a dood, he’s just a bit effeminate. They all have names too, but they’re never said in game.I absolutely adore this game.I grew up playing Golden Axe in arcades and on my Sega Genesis.I never had a Super Nintendo.So I saw it at friends houses.Playing later, I fell in love with it.Later in life I bought it for the Playstation capcom collection and I still play it to this day."

        "Minister Pandor takes action at troubled Vaal University of TechnologyMinister of higher education Naledi Pandor has had enough of the \"serious governance and management challenges\" at Vaal University of Technology (VUT), south of Joburg.She has appointed former Unisa vice-chancellor professor Barney Pityana and National Library CEO professor Rocky Ralebipi-Simela to investigate problems at VUT and advise her \"how to restore good governance to the executive management and the council\".The four-campus university has about 22,000 students and is one of the largest technical universities in the country.Senior management has been writing to the minister since last year to ask for her intervention at the embattled institution.At the beginning of November, registrar Dan Mokoena and then director in the office of the vice-chancellor, Mpho Diago, asked Pandor to investigate the university and its council.The university has been accused of failing to implement the recommendations of a forensic report into procurement irregularities - alongside a host of other claims, including the harassment of staff.The minister was also asked to look at issues undermining the \"academic integrity of the university\".In response, Pandor asked the university council to investigate allegations of corruption and death threats.Diago, part of the senior executive management, claimed in council meetings that he had received death threats when trying to stamp out corruption.Earlier his year, he left VUT with a R4m settlement after clashing with vice-chancellor professor Gordon Zide.Pandor has now intervened and written to the council to call for an independent team to investigate, warning that the current circumstances \"undermine the effective functioning of the university\".Pityana and Ralebipi-Simela now have 90 days to investigate and report back to Pandor.They are tasked with looking into financial management and procurement practices, human resources, administration matters and any financial irregularities.They also need to verify all the forensic reports conducted since 2013.",
        "Some of these reports investigate security company tenders and questionable procurement practices.SowetanLIVE sister publication Times Select reported last week that the council - the highest governing body of the university - is no longer able to hold meetings as it does not have the legally required number of people as required by law.Nine external members have resigned since October.In February, the council's deputy chairperson Ulandi Exner wrote a resignation letter to the minister titled: \"Allegations of maladministration by the vice-chancellor at the Vaal University of Technology\".Pandor responded to the letter, seen by Times Select: \"It is indeed unfortunate that the disturbing developments at the university have [led] to your resignation and that of several other council members.\"Pandor met with the VUT council in mid-April to discuss the allegations of corruption and the many resignations.In her letter about the investigation, she told the council chairperson that she would not approve the \"council recovery plan\" they submitted to her after the meeting.\"I have perused the plan and I have decided not to approve it, as I deem it insufficient to address the serious governance and management challenges that have arisen at the university,\" said Pandor.VUT spokesman Mike Khuboni said senior university management had met on Tuesday but were not able to discuss the investigation as they had other matters on the agenda.",
        "The meeting on the independent investigation ordered by Pandor would be held on Wednesday.\"The letter [from Pandor] was tabled for discussion at today's [Tuesday] executive management meeting by the registrar. However, we did not manage to discuss this particular item as we had other items to discuss.",
        "The meeting had to be adjourned as the VC [vice-chancellor] and the registrar had to attend another urgent meeting, externally.\"I hope the meeting will resume tomorrow [Wednesday] and then the executive management will make a pronouncement.\"Khuboni has previously said the vice-chancellor felt targeted by staff as he has tried to stamp out corruption at the institution and ordered forensic investigations into dysfunctional departments.Pandor's spokesperson Lunga Ngqengelele said: \"The minister has been concerned about the reports she has been receiving about VUT for some time.",
        "She has had several meetings with all the stakeholders to try to get to the bottom of what was going on, which yielded very few results.\"She has now decided to appoint an independent assessor, professor Barney Pityana, to investigate almost all the allegations the minister has been receiving and advise her on what should be done to bring back VUT to a sound footing.\"Would you like to comment on this article or view other readers' comments?",

There is an embed code that lets me include them on the blog in a basic HTML widget and periodically I will get them into this album.",

        "Ready to get to meetings so I can take photos of some of the awesome farmers I get to meet!What I Have Learned So FarThere are lots of little things I’ve already started thinking about. Things I didn’t necessarily think about as I decided to take on the challenge of doing this.- I take photos so often that I see the world through a camera’s lens fairly frequently. I love that the communities where I’m sharing these are not camera snobs.",
        "Sure, I have cameras that will pass most people’s screens for decent equipment, but I also take a lot of mobile photos with my iPhone or point and shoot. That is all good with me and it seems I’ve found folks who agree.- While I loved the focus Kerry did, her’s was for work and I want mine to be flexible. I’m already glad I put that “colorful adventures” label on mine as I think the discipline of doing this daily will be enough for me, much less staying that focused!",
        "LOL.- Rather than just snapping a photo, I think differently about them from the standpoint that I get one photo a day. And I’m thinking of how all those photos reflect my year. That’s different than snapping pics as you go along and sharing them on Facebook or Twitter. This means I want them to be interesting to me and others as well as tell the story of my year.",
        "Lots of flexibility and opportunity there, and it is mine to take full advantage of!- The project has some neat connectivity to other folks who love photography. I’m meeting folks who share one of my passions. Whether we share subject matter interests or not, we share an interest in capturing light, movement, the obvious and exotic, etc.",
        "This is proving pretty cool and I’m only three days in!- I’m wondering if there is a pool running on how long it takes til I miss a day.What do you enjoy enough to commit to making it a daily habit for a full year?JP – I have $5 on that bet…I\\’ve taken all mine but haven\\’t got them all posted. One thing I have already found is it\\’s going to be a challenge to come up with a fresh and interesting topic each day. Not so much the topic but something others can enjoy.",
        "Also when you come to work in the dark and leave in the dark, it\\’s pretty much at lunch time or some other travel during the day. It will definitely be a serious commitment! 🙂MarkI’m looking forward to longer days for sure… and you know travel is a great photo subject for me!I started my own project 365 and like you I\\’m not working within a set theme but will be more flexible as to what I photograph. I look forward to keeping up with you through your images!!! Good luck.",
        "🙂Where are you posting your 365 project pics?I love the late night at the office picture, just gorgeous.Thanks Diana!I\\’m inspired and love the idea that you only get to post one per day, which means that while you may take a bunch of pictures throughout the day, you have to pick one that captures something about that day or what\\’s happening in your life at the moment. I think I\\’m going to join you.",
        "I don\\’t know if I have something from each of the last 6 days I can post…but should have something from most of them since I just got a dog and am a bit obsessed right now.I\\’ll post my pictures on Facebook every day with a weekly wrap up on the blog I linked to via my name.Glad to have another friend doing this! I’m really enjoying the process & interactions."

        "Is the art world too sensitive to see itself in the corrosively shiny veneer of reality television? To hear artists and art critics kvetch on blogs, in the arts press and at art openings, it appears Bravo’s new series, \"Work of Art: America’s Next Great Artist,\" is ruffling feathers.\"Just watched 1st epi of bravo's 'work of art.' truly terrible,\" wrote an artist friend in her Facebook post. \"What's with all the painters?",
        "and since when did 'i can't sell this' become a valid critique?\" Jenn Graves, art critic for Seattle’s Stranger, emphatically concurred: \"The show was horrible. Really, truly awful. Critic Jerry Saltz was the biggest disappointment for me: Is it the editing, or does he really believe that the mission statement of art is, 'Art is a way of showing the outside world what your inside world is like.' So is vomiting.\" \"The overall quality of artist-crew is at best uneven,\" writes Regina Hackett in ArtsJournal.",
        "Even one of the show's judges, the aforementioned Jerry Saltz, noted his ambivalence in a New York magazine blog posting: \"Art on TV and in movies always comes off creepy.\"Contemporary art has never quite jibed with mainstream media.",
        "Art, it seems, gets close to the mainstream only when it combines big money and pop iconography — Damien Hirst, Banksy, Jeff Koons, or the perennial Andy Warhol, who famously cameo-ed on \"The Love Boat.\" But the show has somehow recruited major auction house kingpin Simon de Pury as the mentor figure, and persuaded the venerable Brooklyn Museum to host a solo show of the winning artist (a longtime museum trustee resigned in protest against the Bravo partnership).",
        "Both are participating in the show despite the risk of being called \"sellouts,\" one of the art world's biggest insults.Part of the reason art so rarely flourishes on TV is that most artists are reluctant to be represented in the mainstream media. Just hearing people on television discuss \"the work\" in art-world lingo, makes us art-world denizens shudder: In the context of highly formatted cable entertainment, it sounds put on and pretentious.",
        "The judges on \"Work of Art,\" for example, look for art that makes them \"feel\" (\"Your art didn’t make us feel anything” being one of host China Chow’s steely dismissal lines), and then there are the clownish, obviously expensive designer clothes they wear to their so-called crits.",
        "It's enough to make you wonder why artists would want to participate (the casting calls attracted hundreds of hopefuls).Nao Bustamante, a contestant who works primarily in performance and is in the first episode relegated to the egotistical villain role, admitted in a recent interview that her participation came with artistic intent. \"I went on as a narrative experiment,\" she told me, meaning to upset the standard narrative of an artist’s career.",
        "One thing you don’t learn on the show is that an art career currently adheres to a chronology: first an MFA, then gallery representation, a string of exhibitions (and maybe sales), a teaching job, a museum retrospective and death (which increases the value of the artwork).\"I wanted to shake up that model, make it uncomfortable,\" Bustamante said.",
        "It’s an artistically honorable sentiment, though it’s fairly clear that her attempts at challenging the system didn't always survive the harsh editing of reality TV.",
        "(True to form, \"Work of Art\" includes archetypal characters familiar to anyone who frequents gallery openings — though \"curated\" for catty drama potential, leaving out the eggheads and socially awkward artists.)\"Work of Art\" attempts to offer an intimate view of the place where artistic creation happens, but it doesn't quite pull that off, in part because it sticks faithfully to the reality TV structure.",
        "Like other shows in the genre, the producers make contestants jump through hoops, in accelerated time frames, to make stuff — a format that has very little to do with real-world creative activities. Artists are as likely to make a portrait in nine hours as a chef combining Cheetos and balsamic is likely to make a great meal. In episode 3, the contestants created book covers, a challenge that ignores the distinctions between fine and commercial art.",
        "It's no wonder the results weren't very good.That said, the show does seem to be getting better,?To cross over into pop culture, we need art icons who can flourish in public, the way Marina Abramovic — an artist whose power and charisma courts and can withstand the glare of the media lights — did with her MOMA retrospective. Is it any wonder that Jeff Koons, whose work is all about pop sentiment, was the only artist to be mentioned by name — twice — in the premiere?",
        "\"Work of Art’s\" $100,000 prize wouldn’t even qualify as a down payment on one of his million-dollar sculptures, but it is a modest price to pay to put working artists, semi-realistically, on the cultural radar. For that, I plan to keep watching.Glen Helfand is a Senior Adjunct Professor at the California College of the Arts, a curator and a critic. His writing has appeared Artforum, Art on Paper, the San Francisco Bay Guardian.Shares"

The important thing is to always be happy, make time for everything.",
        "If I was strict on my running schedule I would have missed out on a fabulous event. Or worse I would have been that awful person who makes scheduling an event impossible due to unavailability.I think one of the worst feelings going into a long run is not being rested. Feeling like I have to go to sleep at 8pm in order to even function for a 8am run. So far the summer is off to a great start. Or the spring is coming to a good end. Either way I am looking forward to 11 miles tomorrow.",

        "\"We've complained about this long enough.\"Freedom Landing, owned and operated by the Housing Authority of Salt Lake City, is in an old Days Inn, so the motel rooms-turned-apartments lack kitchens.The new diner just off the lobby was once a breakfast room and, after the Housing Authority turned the motel into transitional housing for homeless veterans, a television room.Now, it is decorated in Americana, with big blue and white floor tiles, the Coca-Cola tables and stools, and a huge bank of red cabinets stocked with canned goods, pasta, rice, cereal and even toilet paper, donated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Veterans will have music from a jukebox where they can play CDs, dock their music players or listen to the radio.One of the two stoves is wheelchair accessible, as are some of the counters and tables.\"Some of them were cooks in the Army.",
        "They'll have to cut their recipes in half,\" joked Diana Leka, director of homeless programs for the housing authority.\"There are just some things you can't cook in a microwave,\" says Kelly Olsen, one of the five female veterans living at Freedom Landing. She served in the Navy in the 1980s.The diner will be good for making friends, she says. \"I tend to isolate sometimes.",
        "I think we're going to have a blast here.\"Charles Oliver, who served in the Navy and Army, pats his belly and says he doesn't expect to eat too much in the diner.\"I gotta reduce a little bit,\" he says.Nonetheless, says Oliver, \"This is a real blessing.\"The goal of transitional housing like Freedom Landing is to help the veterans gain stability so they can live independently and work.",
        "The Department of Veterans Affairs has five case managers on site who work with the veterans, and the VA pays the housing authority a per diem amount for each veteran, which covers the agency's costs.",
        "Between 40 percent and 50 percent of the veterans at Freedom Landing have jobs and pay 30 percent of their rent, Leka says.The project began three years ago as part of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki's goal of ending veteran homelessness by 2015.\"We may be the first of the states and Salt Lake may be the first community in ending homeless veterans,\" says Bill Nighswonger, executive director of the housing authority.Fewer homeless veteransThe number of veterans living on the streets in Utah was 33 in 2012, and another 297 were in transitional housing funded through the Department of Veterans Affairs or in area shelters, says Al Hernandez, who runs the VA's homeless program.",
        "Hernandez expects the 2013 numbers due out in April to be even lower. The federal government has been spending millions of dollars to try to end veteran homelessness.See more about comments here."

        "THE WELLSPRING OF HOPEWhere can we find Hope, and How do we then sustain it ? 'The whole of creation relates to God, as air to the sun' (St.Thomas Aquinas). Yes of course, our internal thoughts can be marshalled to achieve a positive outlook on our lives, but Aquinas is saying that that is a mechanical explanation, sufficient in the short term, but it does not really get to the deep centre where REAL hope and sustenance can be found. - 'God alone exists by nature, for existing is what he IS.",
        "Whereas creatures only share in existence, existing is not what they are. As St.Augustine says : If at any time the ruling power of God were to desert what he created, his creation would immediately lose its form, and all nature would collapse.' As always in life, we are yet again at a junction in the road.",
        "Do we take a mechanistic view of life and creation, that the world was formed solely by atoms and temperatures combining fortuitously and that now we live in an environment of total chance, or that there was a Creator who is looking after us , even when everything is seemingly dark. The context is one of love and from that, springs Hope.",
        "We hope that even on the blackest day, a good of some kind will arise, because evil, which is a falling away from the correct path, requires more than mere chance to be overcome. So hope in a higher force (God) is where logically we need to address our attention. In itself that is not easy, bearing in mind the distracting countervailing views whirling around. 'God is at work in us, in our willing and in our achieving.",
        "God moves our will, but he does not coerce it.'It is so important therefore, to work towards understanding God's gifts and our consequent responsibilities. Then we begin to become more stable emotionally, more compassionate; we use our reason and our will more correctly, all linked to the daily use of the virtues of Justice; Courage; Temperance; Wisdom. Thank you. Tom BaxterLatest comments"

Laid in bed hungover lamenting the fact that my husband was golfing while my head was throbbing. After my petite pity party, I texted a fellow abandoned wife, and it was decided that we would drink white wine on the patio and eat chips and salsa. So off I went to the store, to buy all the stuff for salsa, and a six pack of Sav. B.",

What I do know is that don’t challenge two ladies to drink as much white wine as they can before the sun goes down…it’s a challenge we will win lose.Roasted Poblano Salsa- 3 roasted poblano peppers- 3 jalapeños, 2 without seeds- 2 Serrano peppers- 1 bunch cilantro- 1 large avocado- ½ large white onion- 2 cloves of garlic- 1 tsp. salt- Juice of 1 lime- 3 tomatillos, boiled in water for 8 minutes until soft- ½ c to 1 c.",

This stays good for 2-3 days and makes a ton.Weird Orange Salsa- 6 tomatoes, quartered- 10 chili de arbol, rehydrated (soak in hot water for an hour) these chilis are usually found in the Mexican aisle where all the “Fiesta” brand spices are- 1 white onion, quartered- 4 cloves of garlic- 2 tbs.",

About 10 minutes. Add to a blender and add the chicken broth and blend until smooth. This is awkwardly orange.",
        "Also—I would never have known that the secret ingredient was powdered chicken broth unless Megan told me.Regular-ish Salsa- 1 can rotel- 2 small tomatoes- 2 cloves garlic- 1 small onion- 1 bunch cilantro- Juice of 1 limeBlend everything together. Surely by now you get the jist. Salsa is easy. Just blend shit together and try it with chips.Apparently these all go well with 100$ worth of Mr. Gattis.

Well, there was a notice board there, and I saw an advertoffering free camping at Port Douglas in exchange for a couple of hourswork.",
        "So I took the number and the day before we were due to leave LakePlacid I gave it a call. The lady (Rhonda) sounded very nice, andexplained she just wanted some gardening done on her property where we couldcamp, and it was only 10 mins from Port Douglas.",
        "So as the weather isstill so nice up here and 4 Mile Beach was calling, we decided to give it a go.We set off from lake Placid on Thursday morning, stopping on the way for a walkand coffee on the beautiful Ellis BeachRhonda's directions weren't the best, but we eventually found her property, ina beautiful location down several minor roads in the middle of the rainforest.But when we arrived, we were amazed to discover that she hadn't lived in theproperty (she has a large pole house on a few acres) for the last six years,and the once beautiful gardens are now very overgrown.There were already 2 other couples there on the property (Josie & Barryfrom Victoria and Heather and Ted from Tassie), so Rhonda had allocated us aspot more around the back that was accessible from a side track up a hill ofstones that the council had recently laid over a new storm drain pipe.So I put the car into 4WD and commenced to pull the van up the stony hill, notrealizing that I cut the corner too tight with the van and managed to roll itswheels on one side off the track and into the storm water gully!!Disaster!!!Upon getting out of the car, I found to my dismay, that the back of the van(the spare wheel) was resting on the track and there was a large boulderpressing into my rear water tank (which thankfully hadn't burst).One of the other campers (Barry) came down, and luckily at that minute a coupleof guys were passing by and they stopped to lend a handjack up the side of the van that was in the ditch, and get some planks of woodunder the wheels, and also remove the large boulder from under my now re-formedwater tank.",
        "Then with the help of the 3 guys pushing and the car in lowrange 4WD, we were able to pull the van out and up the slope.However, the fun wasn't over yet, as it took a lot of reversing to get it intothe level space that was originally a large shade cloth area for plants.But we did it, and spent the rest of the day setting up the van. Luckily,even though the tank is, as I said - \"reformed\" it all still seems tobe working OK and there is no other apparent damage.",
        "The fun will begetting out of there!!stones and soil over the past few days to make the access swing wider.That night we spent with Rhonda and the 2 other couples around a huge campfire, talking and drinking until 12:30am!!",
        "We also put jacket spuds in the firewhich were yummy, and the days drams seemed less significant!!!The next couple of days, we worked in the mornings, clearing lots of wood andweeds, and then spent the afternoons on 4 Mile Beach, and the evenings aroundthe camp fire, as there is no TV reception available up here (is the Olympicsstill on??)However, yesterday, Sunday, we decided to take a day off, and went into PortDouglas for the huge Sunday Market, and then had a lovely lunch (Barramundi& chips) on the deck of the Combined Clubs watching the boats go by with acouple of alesstill so fantastic.Today, we again spent the morning working, and now we are sitting beside alovely creek, just down the road from Rhonda’s for the afternoon.",
        "We have decided tomove on tomorrow (as we will have been here 5 nights by then) and we havebooked 1 night into a caravan park at Fishery Falls, which is south ofCairns. Will be sorry to leave Port Douglas as weather is perfect, but stillso much to see, so will have to start heading back south. As long as wecan get off tomorrow, or we will end up like the other caravan in the photo!!!Hi guys, boy! are you having fun - albeit not always the sort of fun that you are looking for.",
        "Hope you get out of there tomorrow or we will have to send in the rescue Keep up the blog as its the next best thing other than being there. Yes the olympics are still on although we are not doing too well this time. Bye for now Luv Mo and Des xxxx"

        "An awful lot of PC gamers buy an awful lot of PC hardware through Amazon. The prices are good, the selection is great, you can go shopping to your heart's content literally without budging from where you're parked right now, and deliveries, while ethically dubious, are fast and reliable.One part of the experience that isn't always quite so reliable, though, is user reviews.",
        "In an update posted today, Amazon said that while it strives to ensure that customer reviews \"accurately reflect the experience that customers have had with a product,\" it warned that fake reviews are becoming increasingly difficult to deal with.\"In 2020, we stopped more than 200 million suspected fake reviews before they were ever seen by a customer, and more than 99% of reviews enforcement was driven by our proactive detection,\" Amazon wrote.",
        "\"In addition to stopping these reviews, we take action to shut down and stop review submissions from the accounts contributing the fake reviews and to enforce the bad actors' selling accounts trying to artificially benefit from this abuse.\"That sounds like a pretty successful campaign against abuse, but because of those efforts, perpetrators have begun taking fake reviews off-site, particularly through social media, either directly or through a third-party service.",
        "This is where the situation grows more complicated: Amazon said it uses \"a number of techniques, including advanced machine learning,\" to combat off-platform abuse, but it's much more challenging to deal with it effectively when it's happening elsewhere, and the numbers are going up.\"In the first three months of 2020, we reported more than 300 groups to social media companies, who then took a median time of 45 days to shut down those groups from using their service to perpetrate abuse,\" it wrote.",
        "\"In the first three months of 2021, we reported more than 1,000 such groups, with social media services taking a median time of five days to take them down.\"Social media platforms are obviously much faster in responding to complaints these days, but in order to address the problem \"at scale,\" Amazon said they need to invest more in \"proactive controls to detect and enforce fake reviews ahead of our reporting the issue to them.\" It also called on consumer regulation agencies for \"coordinated assistance\" in bringing legal action against fake review service providers and those who use them.\"We need social media companies whose services are being used to facilitate fake reviews to proactively invest in fraud and fake review controls, partner with us to stop these bad actors, and help consumers shop with confidence,\" Amazon wrote.",
        "\"It will take constant innovation and partnership across industries and law enforcement to fully protect consumers and our honest selling partners.\"It might be difficult to work up much sympathy for the travails of the multi-billion-dollar behemoth Amazon, but user review abuse is a long-standing and widespread problem. Probably the best-known example among PC gamers is that of Valve, which has struggled with the problem for years.",
        "Despite measures including \"histogram\" charts, the exclusion of \"off-topic\" reviews, and automated prompts to update old reviews, it's still a problem: Nier: Automata suffered a significant review-bombing in March at the hands of users who wanted it updated to match the version available on the Windows Store.",
        "If Amazon is able to come up with an effective strategy to meaningfully reduce user review abuse, it could prove beneficial for other platforms and storefronts (and everyone who uses them) in the long run too."

Radlers are becoming such a hot commodity that Liquor Marts and beer vendors are having a hard time keeping them in stock.",
        "As far as I can count so far, Labatt has three radlers available in Manitoba right now, including Bud Light Radler, with possibly more to come through their Mill Street, Stanley Park or Goose Island operations.Radlers have been available in Manitoba for as long as I can remember but I recall bypassing them completely because they were simply 50% beer/50% grapefruit juice, and I’m not someone who generally cares about grapefruit juice.",
        "Radlers will always be the beer of choice for cyclists, but it’s also the beer of choice for those who want something refreshing, light yet fruity at same time.This week I’ve chosen three Non-Labatt Canadian craft brewed Radlers that are worth cycling to.",
        "(Please drink responsibly)Pump House Crafty Radler - I’ve been a fan of Moncton's Pump House since back in the day when the pub-based predecessor of Farmery Brewery (Luxalune Gastropub) used to have an interesting selection of craft beers that were only available at their pub and nowhere else in Manitoba, their Blueberry Ale was always a hit in the summer time, while their Scotch Ale was a hit in the winter. Pump House recently brought out a new Radler called Crafty Radler.",
        "Crafty Radler is brewed with lager and a mixture of grapefruit and tangerine juices. Crafty Radler pours a cloudy straw beer with a hint of pulp-like sediment throughout the beer. The aroma starts out being reminiscent of 7-UP with a bit of lime and lemon then the notes of grapefruit and tangerine pop up quickly after.",
        "The taste starts off with a heavy dose of grapefruit mixed with lime and lemon but the tangerine really helps deal with the tartness of the sour fruits by adding a hint of orangey sweetness, though I wish there was a bit tangerine in there. Incredibly tasty and likely the strongest Radler of the night as it tops out at 4.7% ABV. Available at Liquor Marts in Brandon. Brandon, Minnedosa and virden for $3.49 per 473mL can.",
        "4.5/5 PintsWaterloo Grapefruit Radler - In my 2015 column, I reviewed Waterloo’s Lemonade Radler as I love lemonade and I wanted to see what the fuss about Radlers was at the time. In my opinion, Waterloo Brewing makes the top selling (non Labatt/Molson/Stiegl) radler in Canada, I see more people buying this beer than Bud Light Radler, but Bud Light just released their Radler days ago so things will change. Waterloo’s Grapefruit Radler pours pale, watery lemon yellow with a bit of sediment.",
        "There’s a great deal of carbonation taking place making it a bit fizzy like a soda. The aroma is full of grapefruit as it is tart yet sweet, a good deal of pepper and a hint of lemon. The taste starts out fairly sweet then the tartness of the grapefruit hits. The weird tartness of grapefruits is the main reason why I never liked grapefruits. There’s a hint of peppery spice in there as well but it’s mostly muted compared to the aroma.",
        "It’s fairly easy to drink and definitely the most tarty of what I’ve had so far, but I’m not done yet! If you’re a grapefruit fan, this Radler is obviously meant for you! Compared to some grapefruit coolers on the market, this one has a natural taste to it instead of a weird syrupy and sugary taste to it. 3.1% ABV. Available at Liquor Marts in Brandon, Dauphin, Swan River and Virden for $3.25 per 473mL can. It may also be available at the Keystone Motor Inn Beer Vendor.",
        "4/5 PintsCentral City Red Racer Radler - Most of you who are familiar with the name “Red Racer” will immediately think of their popular India Pale Ale in the green cans. The Red Racer line from Surrey BC’s Central City Brewing is actually a wide selection of products from pilsners to pumpkin ales and.. yes, a Radler. Red Racer Radler just popped back at the MLCC two weeks back after an eight month hiatus.",
        "The Radler pours a thick and cloudy orange beer but doesn’t have any sort of sediment like the two previous beers. The aroma has notes of grapefruit, lime, lemon, a hint of pepper, and a light grassiness from the hops. The taste starts off with a bit of a Five Alive flavour to it as I’m getting lime and grapefruit popping up at the same time. It’s fairly tart and even has a light taste of crackers to it, which I haven’t seen in any other of the beers.",
        "This one is probably the smoothest of the bunch but after drinking three Radlers by myself, I wish I was sharing this with someone or if my portions were only in 4-8oz sampler sizes instead - that’s just too much grapefruit juice for one person! The grapefruit is complimented by lime in this one but it still has the tartiness and peppery bite that I experienced in the rest of the Radlers. 3.5% ABV. You can find this at Liquor Marts in Brandon and Dauphin for $2.73 per 473mL can.",
        "4/5 PintsLastly, two new beer releases: With today being Cinco de Mayo, Vankleek Hill, Ontario’s Beau’s All Natural Brewing has launched their Buenos Dias Gruit Ale.

        "Well the shortlist for the 2010 New Zealand Post Book Awards is out … and I didn’t make it. Oh well.The NZSA Jessie Mackay Award for Best First Book of Poetry has gone to Selina Tusitala Marsh for Fast Talking PI (AUP).",
        "Congratulations Selina!The shortlist for the Best Poetry Book is a Mainland affair –- Bernadette Hall for The Lustre Jug (VUP),- Michael Harlow for The Tram Conductor’s Blue Cap (AUP),- and Brian Turner for Just This (VUP).And poets have taken over the Fiction category too:- Fiona Farrell, Limestone (Vintage)- Owen Marshall, Living as a Moon (Vintage)- Alison Wong, As the Earth Turns Silver (Penguin).An interesting selection.",
        "I have all three of the poetry books, so shall have to sit down and reread them. I don’t have Selina’s book, although it’s been on my books-to-investigate list for a while now.I think though that it’s a pity they don’t have a shortlist for Best First Book – and not just because it might have given me hope for a few months longer (I’ll though I’ll admit an element of that … sigh!). But it would have been interesting to know who made the shortlist, and who else was considered.",
        "Something to talk about. An acknowledgement that there was more than one book in the running. On the other hand, it does mean that three first time authors get an extra two month of celebrating …So, who do you think should win? Do any of the choices surprise you? Please you? Irritate you? And what is it about the South Island that produces so many fabulous writers?Sorry you didn’t make it babe – I mean, Joanna. Well done the Mainland, though, and huge ups for your generous post.",
        "I will have to read these books now – I have, to my shame, read none of them, although I have a couple there on the PILE to read…. looking at them now.Well, she says stoutly, I think you should be in the running–but I am rather partisan! 🙂 Although all 3 of the finalists have strong claims, as well (I can actually put my hand on my heart and say that I have read them all!)I haven’t read Selina’s book yet … but Ruth Todd at Women on Air tells me she really enjoyed it.",
        "Will have to put it on the pile now.I agree with you about no shortlist for the new poets: I really think that’s a fizz, especially as it was the new poets that I enjoyed reading and interviewing most last year.I will keep my fingers crossed that the Mary Gilmore Prize in Aus comes through for you and The Summer King–and most deservedly imho.I also am very sad about the demise of the best first book shortlists. I’d only just really noticed their existence, and they were gone again.",
        "I thought they were a really nice way of giving a bit extra attention to a few newer writers. The whole awards seems such a pinched affair this year, with only four categories and not many books in each.Sorry that you didn’t make the shortlist. There’s no accounting for taste.I agree, too, that it would have been good to have a shortlist for Best First Book, it is great to have several new writers to explore.",
        "I enjoyed The Lustre Jug, but not as much as Bernadette’s previous book, The Ponies – I could never fathom why that one missed the shortlist. I also have Michael Harlow’s book but I haven’t read Brian Turner’s yet. Loved Limestone, and have been thinking of reading As the Earth Turns Silver, but I already have a big pile of unread books and not enough time 😦"

        "Published: 03rd July 2019How Yoga taught this young Yogini the art of letting go and embracing the futureShivali worked under a designer for a year and was all set to pursue her Master's in Architecture abroad when she changed her mind and went back to LonavlaStriking an asana | (Pic: Shivali Shukla)Once one truly understands the essence of yoga, it gets very difficult to relate to the world and its materialistic ways. And this is what happened with Shivali Shukla.",
        "This Hyderabadi girl undertook her first ten-month course in yoga at Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute and Research Center in Lonavla in 2010. \"My father is a great believer when it comes to yoga and he encouraged me to take up the course,\" says the youngster. From there to today, yoga took her to Lonavla, Rishikesh, Mysuru and now, she is in Thailand, teaching the art form. \"I am not sure what will happen next, I am just going with the flow. And even this, I learnt through yoga.",
        "I used to try and control things, but now, I've learnt to let go. And life has surprised me every time,\" she says with a smile.On point: Shivali doing what she does best | (Pic: Shivali Shukla)Like every good yoga instructor, Shivali too advocates the fact that yoga needs to go beyond asanas, though she also acknowledges that it is a difficult task to inculcate in students. \"Most of the current generation thinks that yoga is boring and for old people.",
        "So to make it a disciplined lifestyle among them is a difficult task. What we could do is give them what they want first, which are asanas, and slowly start teaching them about the core aspects,\" offers the 26-year-old and explains, \"They want to do Instagram-worthy asanas, so it's okay to start with focusing on physical fitness and then drive them to see the other benefits.\"Shivali worked with CultFit briefly and taught yoga there.",
        "She has also freelanced and taken classes on her ownAnd what about goat yoga and puppy yoga, videos of which are going viral on social media? Shivali laughs and says, \"I am not completely against or for it, but it's definitely a distraction. If you want more awareness and there is a puppy in the room, how will you focus on self? It just reduces the form to an interesting way of doing a physical workout,\" she opined. Shivali asserts, again and again, that yoga is about you and your mat.",
        "\"Eventually, a sense of detachment develops which helps one cope with anxiety,\" says Shivali who has a Bachelor's in Design degree from Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University, Hyderabad.Acing the game: Shivali doing yoga outdoors | (Pic: Shivali Shukla)Shival says that you need to keep practicing it, even when on a few days, one might feel agitated or unfocused. Persistently sticking to the art form will help reveal its benefits.",
        "\"Over time, you will learn to carry this motivation throughout the day,\" she says. Talking about the International Day of Yoga, she says that yoga is the need of the hour, especially in a world which is wrought with stress and anxiety.",
        "\"It is important to spread awareness about yoga and let the world know the benefits of adopting it as a lifestyle,\" she says.All in a day:Some asanas as performed by ShivaliMALASANA: Also known as the Garland Pose, it helps stretch the back and legs | (Pic: Shivali Shukla)PARIVRTTA PRASARITA PADOTTANASANA: This strengthens hamstrings, thighs and calf musclesPARIVRTTA JANU SIRSASANA: This asana stimulates the liver, kidneys and other organs | (Pic: Shivali Shukla)Tracing the yogini's journeyYoga has taken Shivali to a lot of places.",
        "Let's see what she learnt from where:- LonavlaAfter pursuing a short course in 2010, she went back to the city to complete her PG Diploma in Yoga. \"My batch had advanced practitioners and I would judge myself too much,\" she recalls.- RishikeshSo, she went away to Rishikesh for self-practice and fell in love with the place, says the 26-year-old. She taught and practiced here.- MysuruThen yoga took her to Mysuru, to Ashtanga Yoga Mysore to be exact, where she taught Ashtanga Yoga.",
        "But felt like she needed to learn more. So she went to another centre in the city, Mysore Hatha Yoga Kendra and here came the turning point of her life. \"My mindset changed and my practice got better. This began to reflect in my ways. I will never forget those four months,\" she saysFor more on her, click on facebook.com/shivali.shukla.54"

        "What to do?by Mr_Arkadin on 2012-11-13 06:18:32Sounds like the pedal part may be faulty.Make sure you really put your weight into the pedal to make it click when calibrating.If you still have no joy the two options are to try and fix it yourself (the pedal may just need cleaning - but I do not know how the Live works internally so do not know how easy of difficult this is), or to send it to your local Line 6 service centre:\">\">Before going down either of those routes you may wish to contact Line 6 Tech Support directly and get a 'ticket' for support:\">\">The information above may not be current, and you should direct questions to the current forum or review the manual."

        "On Friday, Antoine Marzin of Oklahoma gave a Moriond talk about the ATLAS search for the third-generation superpartners. At the end, we didn't learn anything that would go beyond the February 14th talk which was itself primarily a review of previously released preprints.The direct stop production doesn't seem to be discussed at all and that's what the stop squark rumors may be all about.",
        "We may learn something new on another conference next week, the Search Workshop in Maryland where Stephanie Majewski speaks next Saturday (she coordinates the stop efforts in the ATLAS' SUSY group, together with Monica D'Onofrio: the four-tops events seem to be very female, indeed). See the list of ATLAS talks in the near future. However, I was still intrigued by some Marzin's graphs that have been shown before.",
        "For example, in the gluino-mediated sbottom analysis, the following graph is relevant:Can you find a strange cross on the picture? Well, I can: look at the center of the picture. If you check the axes, you will see that the cross describes 2 events in a bin around \\(1,650\\GeV\\). Are two events too many? Well, it depends...To answer this question, you must look at the theoretical prediction. It's shown as the blue curve on my recolored version of the graph.",
        "There are some strange blue teeth near \\(1,500\\GeV\\) and \\(1,900\\GeV\\) but they're so strange that I believe they're just some artifacts of Monte Carlo calculations. If you extrapolate the decreasing blue curve in the left part of the picture, you may conclude that the prediction for the \\(1,650\\GeV\\) bin is just 0.01 events or so. Instead, they got 2!",
        "Yes, that's two factorial which is, happily enough, equal to two.The probability that you get two events like that is about \\(0.01^2=0.0001\\) if my numbers are right. Well, it's actually close to one-half of this small number. It's unlikely to see too many events like that. Let me say in advance that if they get an event like that for each inverse femtobarn of data – the graph above uses 2/fb – they may already have 5 events of this kind.",
        "The probability of such a thing would be close to 0.0000000001, i.e. really tiny.To make things even more puzzling, there is another graph in Marzin's talk:It has one similarly surprising event near \\(1,550\\GeV\\). Both graphs show events with two bottom-quark jets, missing energy, and something else. The first graph requires 1 additional lepton; the second graph requires 0 leptons. That's the only difference between them.I should finally say what the \\(x\\)-axis actually is.",
        "Well, it's the effective mass given by \\[\\large m_{\\rm eff} = /\\!\\!\\!\\! E_T + \\sum_{j\\in \\rm jets} p_T^{(j)} + \\sum_{l\\in \\rm leptons} p_T^{(l)}\\] One is summing the missing transverse energy and the transverse momentum of all jets and leptons. That's what the effective mass always means.You may see that this quantity isn't terribly Lorentz-invariant. That's why you never expect completely sharp peaks as a function of this effective mass.",
        "For pair-production of superpartners, you don't expect sharp peaks for its own related reasons, either. Because the superpartners are probably heavier than all the normal R-parity-even particles from which the pair may be born, this normal R-parity-even particle has to be virtual. So there's no reason why the total energy of the superpartners in the pair should be any sharp number.I consider supersymmetry extremely beautiful and persuasive at the theoretical level.",
        "Experimenters often say that it will ultimately lead to fireworks of discoveries when the time arrives. But I admit that I am not too excited by the modified gradual curves. New physics that could produce new sharp peaks in some graphs would be so much prettier! Don't you agree?We have all the reasons to think that there shouldn't be any sharp peak in these graphs so these three events are coincidental and they will fade away as more collisions are recorded and evaluated. But maybe they won't.",
        "If that's so, there could be some particle whose mass is related to those \\(1,600\\GeV\\). I don't know what it could be.One should admit that there seems to be some excess – in this case more uniformly distributed – in the events with a single high-energy bottom jet, too.Do you see the three bins between \\(1,400\\) and \\(1,700\\GeV\\)?",
        "Finally, I am moderately surprised by the single event near \\(550\\GeV\\) in this multijet graph:In this graph, one chooses events with at least 4 jets and exactly 1 lepton and with missing transverse energy above \\(100\\GeV\\); the missing transverse energy (and not the effective mass) is shown on the \\(x\\)-axis in this case which is the actual reason why the value, \\(550\\GeV\\), is substantially smaller in this case. Again, the Standard Model predicts pretty much no collisions over there.",
        "According to the Standard Model, the missing transverse energy should hide in neutrinos and they're unlikely to have very high energies like that.I have mentioned that the direct stop pair production seems to be \"completely\" absent in these analyses so that's where we might expect some stunning surprises in the future.",
        "However, it's also plausible that the strange events discussed above have grown once the dataset was (more than) doubled and they're suggesting some new physics interacting with the third-generation quarks...I've always known that the Greek default wouldn't be an important event but it was such a non-event...oka non climatic event...24ºC by day(only 6ºc by night)moisture 0% (129 days without rain in winter time and Nov-Dec)if you can turn some quark's in water or wine should be fine..."

I know one or two of you can’t begin until November 1 and that is just fine.The class is at the Independent Living Resource Center San Francisco from 3-5pm. The address is 649 Mission, cross streets are 2nd and 3rd. It is right next door to the Cartoon Art Museum. The closest BART is Montgomery.",

        "This Christmas and New Years, my plans involved driving thousands of miles to visit family. Because of this, I thought it would be a good time to give Audible.com a try. If you are unfamiliar with Audible, they are an Amazon company that specializes in audio books. I signed up for a 30 day free trial that included two free downloads and promptly pulled down Michael Lewis’ book titled ‘The Big Short’ that detailed the financial crisis in the subprime mortgage lending business.",
        "I chose this title because I liked reading ‘Moneyball’ so I thought this would be an equally interesting read/listen. It was a good book, but it was about as interesting as the financial crises can be, which is not very. I was looking for a more moving experience.I had always known about the book ‘Ball Four’, but beyond knowing the author’s name and that it was regarded as the best baseball book ever written, I couldn’t tell you anything about it.",
        "After listening to an episode of the great podcast ‘Gleeman and the Geek’ (see), co-host Aaron mentioned if he could download any book to listen to off Audible.com, it would probably be ‘Ball Four’. This was enough for me to give it a try.After pulling the book down on my Samsung Galaxy S III using the Audible.com app, I was stunned to see the book came in at a whopping 18 hours and 32 mins. I figured it was probably a mistake and dove right in.",
        "The book itself is narrated by Jim Bouton himself which adds to the charm. The emotion he reads with makes the listener feel like they’re reliving the moments while they were happening.The book itself is a diary of Jim Bouton’s experiences during the 1969 season with the newly formed Seattle Pilots (the only team in the modern history of Major League Baseball to go bankrupt) and his subsequent trade to the Houston Astros.",
        "After finishing the main book, it is no wonder this was selected by the New York Public Library as one of the “Books of the Century.” The stories in the book are both hilarious and genuine.What made the audio book amazing was what came after the reading of ‘Ball Four’. Every 10 years after the initial publishing, Jim wrote a follow-up (starting with the aptly titled ‘Ball Five’).",
        "These chronicled not only what had happened to Bouton over the previous 10 years, but updates on a lot of the ballplayers in the original book and commentary on the state of the game.",
        "Jim offered insightful comments on Pete Rose being banned from baseball (he thinks a gambling addiction is no worse than a drug addition and it’s hypocritical of baseball picks and chooses which addictions to punish rather than focus on the disease of addiction), Bouton’s being blacklisted from Old Timer’s Day from the Yankee’s and how he co-founded Big League Chew.",
        "In one of the final updates, Jim details any parents worst nightmare… the night he and his wife received a phone call that his daughter Laurie had been in a bad car accident and was in a coma. As a listener, hearing him talk about that night and losing his youngest child made not only the author tear up, but it got a little dusty in the car. His voice quivered and my eyes watered.",
        "I never expected to be so moved from what I thought would be a baseball book.In the end, this book wasn’t about baseball, but rather a remarkable group of people living their dreams in an extraordinary time period and about perseverance and hard work.",
        "At the end of the book, I fondly look back at my baseball memories and the great friends I made playing baseball and can’t help but be thankful that Audible and Jim Bouton came together.If you have any thoughts and you’re not too busy ‘beaver shooting’, feel free to drop a note in the comments."

So, Team Sonic leader Yojiro Ogawa what the hell happened?.That still doesn't excuse the human kissing. WE SHALL NOT FORGET!Team Sonic Interview [Kikizo]Sounds like a good exuse for the PS3 version. And for the 360? I suppose the reason for it being bad is because it's not good.",
        "Maybe that's also George Bush's fault.Well, Sacred Rings is getting some decent mentions in alot of places. Check out Gamerankings.Sure, that explains the crappy load times. It doesn't explain why they thought putting realistic-looking humans and Sonic in scenes together was okay.I think the whole article was mistranslated.",
        "The real answer was probably more like \"because Sega corp isn't exactly flush with cash and we figured even if we shipped this piece of crap, people would still buy it and put money in the coffers\".Cause that's the real answer in the end. Companies almost never make games as art. They're making games in order to sell copies of them.",
        "If you can figure out way to make a game people will buy (Madden!) without it being any good, wasting money making it good just reduces your profit margins.EA has learned this very well.Furries loved the human kissing, thus Sega was appealing to Sonic's core fanbase.",
        "Srsly, besides those drama queens, who really truly loves Sonic and his games anymore?The rest of us are merely holding out hope that he'll stop sucking.I'm picking up Secret Rings tomorrow, so here's hoping....I think though, they need to dig into Sonic's roots a bit...",
        "Ditch the extraneous hedgehogs (Anyone not named 'Sonic' or 'Mecha-Sonic'), no humans, maybe leave Espio, Tails, Knuckles in there...Stop trying so hard with the X-treme plot, maybe introduce something like the American Sonic Saturday Morning cartoon (the one with the squirrel princess, and the 1/2 roboticized bunny, and the Walrus) ... maybe? I liked the simple 'Eggman's making all the animals into robots, we're resisting Eggman.' plot. No weirdo Chaos emerald chaos gods, no...",

        "Do they really expect you to be that accurate bouncing around those blue things and collecting those yellow things - all while dodging those other yellow things? This is like another one of those games where your poor repressive motor skills can't properly coordinate to because it is so overtly complicated and very time-consuming.I think the closest they've ever come to a good 3D Sonic game was Sonic Adventure 1+2 (And those were still only just above average games).",
        "Everything after has just progressively stunk, Heroes was awful and if Sonic The Hedgehog is really as bad as everyone says it is then it looks like it's following the same trend. Unfortunately either they just can't find a way to effectively make a good 3D Sonic game or they really just aren't doing it right.Excuses...all excuses...Here's a clue Sonic Team: play the game before it releases.",
        "If it's not enjoyable, with a camera that is worse than any boss enemy, suspect controls, terrible voice acting and the music is ridiculously annoying rock that doesn't fit, then the game is a failure.I used to respect Yuji Naka and Sonic Team. Now they are one of the worse developers I've seen in years.",
        "How can you continually embarrass your development team by reducing your key mascot to shovelware status.Come to think of it...Other then the barebones port of VF5...has Sega released anything worthy of mention lately?I say make Sonic 2D again. Sonic in the 3D world sucks badly.I've played through Myst a couple times and I never saw Sonic running around.That explains the glitches, even though it was a very poor team decision.",
        "So where are the excuses for the horrible game design or was that just intentional?Haha, as if they couldn't have delayed the PS3 launch. With analyst predicting shortages months in advanced on the PS3 there should have been no indication that the install base would be high enough to warant a rush for launch.",
        "Brilliant strategy boys.The last two or three didn't have any \"launch pressure\" so the excuses don't hold water.SEGA published another Sonic game with real problems becuse they sell plenty with little investment. Until now of course.Hey, Sonic Team, the real pressure is on now.Why does everything have to be 3d can't they just make an awesome side scroll Sonic, ala Cloning Clyde which was very good, very successful . .",
        ".It would be less intensive to develop(cheaper) and profitable(corporate will be pleased).Sure, that excuse works. For the first game. The thing is, Sonic has had the same issues for the last two iterations.

        "Herbert Grover will retire as Dean of the School of Math and Sciences at the end of the spring semester. Dr. Scott Franklin will move into the Dean’s position and Dr. Trish Trifilo will fill the Director of the Virtual Campus position vacated by Dr. Franklin.A biology professor, Dr. Grover came to Wayland in 2008 and was named Dean of the School in 2009. Under his leadership the School has flourished.",
        "Grover has played a key role in developing the curriculum for majors in environmental science and environmental studies. He has also placed in emphasis on creation care, and raised awareness of the importance of caring for God’s world through conservation efforts throughout the Wayland system.“Dr. Grover has certainly taken what was already an outstanding academic school and made it even stronger during his term a school dean,” said WBU Executive Vice President and Provost Dr. Bobby Hall.",
        "“He has grown the distinctiveness of the academic program with emphases on quality, undergraduate research, and field experience.”Students in the math and science departments have benefitted through increased efforts in undergraduate research, as well as field research opportunities.",
        "The biology and geology departments regularly take study trips, providing more practical, hands-on educational experiences, and all fields of specialization conduct student research projects and present their findings at national conventions.Grover earned his bachelor’s degree at Rider University in 1974 and a master’s from Rutgers in 1977. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of New Mexico in 1982 and came to Wayland after serving as Professor of Biology at Hardin-Simmons University since 1995.",
        "He has also served in various teaching and research capacities at the University of New Mexico.Grover said the decision to step down as dean is the result of many factors, including the need to move the School into a more technologically driven environment, something he admitted may not be his strength.",
        "He also wants to spend more of his time with his personal academic pursuits.“I look at the things that need to be done and how they need to be done to move the school to the next level and I see there are better people to accomplish that than me,” he said.",
        "“And I want to invest more of my energy in environmental science areas that interest me.”Grover said he hesitates to say he is “retiring” as he hopes this is just another chapter in his academic life.“Wayland has been the best place I have ever worked in my life,” he said. “I could not have asked for a better place to complete the classroom portion of my career.",
        "I will continue to be active and write and create things and teach online, but the mountains are calling and my grandkids are calling.”With Grover’s departure, Dr. Franklin will move into the position of Dean of the School of Math and Sciences. Franklin, a 1998 graduate of Wayland, earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from Texas Tech University in 2005. He has taught mathematics at Wayland since 2000, and served as Associate Dean under Grover.",
        "In 2011, Franklin was named Director of the Virtual Campus.“I look forward to continuing the high standards and quality leadership set forth by Dr. Grover,” Franklin said. “Our emphasis in the school has always been on engaging and close interaction between our faculty and our students, and we also closely integrate our faith in the classroom.”As Franklin moves back to the science building, he will leave the virtual campus in capable hands. Dr.",
        "Trifilo has been with the VC full time since 2012, serving as the Distance Learning Specialist. Trifilo holds a doctorate in education from Capella University and a master’s degree in science from St. Louis University. She earned her bachelor’s degree at the University of Iowa. Trifilo came to Wayland after working as the director of online learning at Hardin-Simmons University.Dr.",
        "Hall said the transitions to new positions should be seamless with no real disruption in services to students.“Wayland is indeed fortunate to have the strength, quality and depth among its employees to make these transitions possible,” hall said. “Just as Dr. Grover brought unique strengths to his potion as dean, both Dr. Franklin and Dr. Trifilo are very well prepared to step into leadership rolls.”"

        "Drivers have been reacting to the switch-on of a new \"throughabout\" in Yeovil on Thursday (February 7), and it's safe to say the new 42 traffic light junction has not gone down well.Words used to describe the new creation include, \"awful\", \"ludicrous\", \"confusing\", \"frustrating\" and \"stupid\", as locals vent their anger at what is seen by many as \"a waste of taxpayers money\".After the new system at Westlands junction was switched on, five months later than originally planned, drivers reported queues were longer than they were before, while a local Ford employee has said that \"not one\" of the customers on his daily test drives understands the new lay-out.Somerset County Council has claimed the new configuration would reduce queues by 75 per cent, while a councillor has described the new layout as \"very simple\".However, angry drivers disagree and they have been making their views known to the council directly online.Writing to the council, Stephen Bramley said: \"Longest queues there have ever been at that roundabout.\"Slow clap to Somerset County Council for making an absolute pig's ear of the junction and wasting taxpayer's money.",
        "Bravo guys.\"He added: \"Next time, give the project to a local primary school, they couldn't possibly make as bad a hash of it as the brain dead planning department in Taunton.\"The council has confirmed the junction will be \"closely monitored\" during the first few months and traffic lights can be adjusted to ensure they are working as efficiently as possible.Take a look at plans for throughabout below.Writing to the council, local resident Martin White said: \"It was a complete farce when I tried to go through it tonight.\"No road markings coming out of Bunford Lane to suggest the correct lane use.\"Mixture of green lights with absolutely nowhere to go and cars trying to drive through each other as there was a traffic jam in the middle of the roundabout.\"It's only by sheer luck that I wasn’t spending the next few hours in A&E.",
        "The light sequencing was obviously not tested prior to going live.\"Somerset Live could only find one positive comment on the new throughabout, from Peter Lovell, who wrote: \"I braved it and I survived it ..it worked well for me today.\"The busy Westlands roundabout has been transformed into a \"throughabout\" as part of the ongoing multi-million pound Western Corridor work in the town, and the improvements now see traffic travelling through the middle of the central island.The throughabout was originally due to be operational more than a week ago (Tuesday, January 29), but a spokesman said this was pushed back due to bad weather, and Thursday (February, 7) was the revised switch-on date.Take a look at some more views on the throughabout below.Locals vent their anger at new throughaboutLocals have been getting in touch via the Somerset Live Facebook page to make their feelings known:Ben King - \"I think it’s great waiting at a red light on a roundabout when there’s no traffic at 9pm!\"Calley Duck-Bingham - \"Literally the worst, most road rage antagonising thing to happen, ever.\"Gloria Cox - \"More money wasted by the Highways Department.\"Shell Swaine - \"The irony with all this work to help ease congestion etc....yet there’s a huge queue!\"Shaun Walters - \"Is this the outcome of a use it or loose it budget?",
        "Absolute nonsense.\"Sam Norris - \"They did this same plan with the roundabout at junction 24 of the M5 with all the traffic lights, it didn't work and back fired to the point the council had wasted money and pulled most of the traffic lights out due to the bad congestion it was causing.\"Simon Hadyn - \"There was nothing wrong with what we had but now the time to get through that section of town has tripled.",
        "And it is going to end up an accident hot spot as it will confuse a lot of drivers out there.\"Ian Trevor - \"It’s like Blackpool illuminations at that end of Yeovil.",
        "I think the person that came up with the planning must have been p***ed out of his brain.\"Somerset Live has approached Somerset County Council for comment on the reaction to the switch-on.Council warns drivers to \"pay close attention\"“It’s actually a very simple design\"Councillor John Woodman.”A spokesman for the council added: .\"Improvements \"will reduce queue lengths\"The council spokesman added: .\"These improvements increase the capacity of the junction and modelling predicts they will reduce future queue lengths down to around 14 cars at peak times, compared with queues of 65 cars if left as a roundabout.\"Drivers urged to \"take extra care\".”Current progress of Western Corridor projectIt has been confirmed the new signalised Copse Road junction will be the next phase to be switched on.Here's how the overall project is shaping up:Bluebell roundabout - LATE : Completed in August 2018 (originally expected by March 2018)Lysander Road junction - ON TIME : Completed before Christmas (originally expected between September 2018 and March 2019)Copse Road junction - LATE : Latest forecast - \"Early 2019\" (Expected by Autumn 2018)Westlands throughabout - LATE : Latest forecast - Thursday, February 6 (originally expected by September 2018)Stourton Way area improvements - LATE : Latest forecast - \"Early 2019\" (originally expected by March 2018)Western Avenue improvements - LATE : Latest forecast - \"Early 2019\" (originally expected by September 2018)Preston Road Roundabout - LATE : Latest forecast - \"June 2019\" (originally expected by March ."

        "Ottawa orders CN, CP to move grain or face fineFederal government says railways must each move at least 500,000 tonnes of Prairie grain a week.AAShare via EmailKen Faught / TORONTO STAR FILE PHOTOGrain elevators across the Prairies are jammed with the 2013 bumper crop.",
        "Ships heading for export markets are sitting empty at West Coast ports waiting for the grain to arrive.Liberal MP Ralph Goodale says the government isn't doing enough to help move grain from Saskatchewan producers.With millions of tonnes of grain stuck on the Canadian Prairies, the federal government is taking the rare step of ordering the railways to get the bumper crop moving or face stiff fines.In Winnipeg, Transport Minister Lisa Raitt announced that a cabinet order issued Friday requires Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific to each move at least 500,000 tonnes of grain, or 5,500 rail cars, a week.If the railways don’t comply, they could face fines of up to $100,000 a day.“This issue affects more than just farmers, it affects trade and Canada’s ability to supply our markets around the world,” said Raitt, who was accompanied by Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz.MORE ON THESTAR.COMThe order, good for 90 days, is renewable.",
        "It takes effect immediately, but the railways have four weeks to ramp up to the required levels.“Canadian Pacific is disappointed with this unfortunate order-in-council,” said CP spokesman Ed Greenberg, arguing the move only raises more questions.It “only focuses on the railways and not the entire supply chain,” he said in an email, noting that moving grain from farm to port is a complex system that needs to operate around the clock.Canadian National spokesman Jim Feeny said the railway will do its part to move the grain, but emphasized co-operation is needed from grain growers and terminal staff, including a strong sales effort for grain shipments made out of Thunder Bay when Great Lakes shipping reopens in the spring.“The federal government wants to play a role here,” Feeny said.",
        "“We’re going to need the federal government to encourage stakeholders, the farmers, the grain companies, the railways to act in a collaborative manner, as opposed to accusation and finger pointing.”CN says it had already told the federal government that as soon as warmer weather arrives, it would ramp up to 5,500 carloads a week.The move comes after farmers in Western Canada have complained that despite their best year ever, they can’t get their crops to market because the railways aren’t moving the grain.",
        "Further, farmers have complained that they are losing money as prices fall.The 2013 yield was about 76 million tonnes — everything from wheat and canola to barley and lentils — up 33 per cent from 2012.Grain elevators are jammed and individual farmers’ bins are full.",
        "Forty-three ships heading for export markets are sitting empty at West Coast ports waiting for the grain to arrive.The railways say the extended, bitterly cold winter has forced them to slow operations, running short rail cars just to keep goods moving.Over the past three months on the Prairies, there have been 49 days of temperatures below minus 25C, nearly double the usual average of 25 days.In a full-page advertisement published Thursday in two national newspapers, CP CEO Hunter Harrison acknowledged service levels haven’t been met, but added winter is a factor.“When the weather is this cold, we must take steps such as reducing train lengths to continue to move freight and ensure the safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate,” Harrison said.While some groups have urged the railways to add more cars just to get the grain moving, Harrison said that would just create a bigger logjam.“It is like adding more cars to a highway at rush hour — everything moves that much slower,” he said.Wade Sobkowich, executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association, which represents the grain companies, said during the best delivery week last fall, only 9,300 rail cars of grain moved.“This will hold the rail companies accountable,” said Sobkowich, but warned that the backlog is so great, even at the government-ordered pace, one-third of the crop won’t get moved by late July, just as next year’s crop starts coming in.“We’re so deep into this problem,” he said.",
        "“It doesn’t give enough capacity to move all of the grain.”Sobkowich also questions whether the railway can put the blame on the cold weather, noting railways were told of the bumper crop in September.“It’s like building a house without insulation and blaming winter when you are cold,” he said.Ritz has promised that the government will introduce legislation to address more regulation in grain shipping.CN’s Feeny argued more regulation is not needed, and any such move “is ill advised and counter productive,” because more regulation would lead to an “adversarial relationship within the supply chain at a time when collaboration is."

        "Another?Despite the grumblings that Apple is failing to shock and wow in the same way as it did when the late Steve Jobs first revealed the iPhone back in 2007, Ben Wood, Head of Research at CCS Insight, argues last week's event and the announcement of iOS11 shows the evolving importance of the smartphone.When iOS11 drops later this year, it will be underpinned by augmented reality and machine learning features, as well as the ability to further support its burgeoning smart home devices.",
        "Developers will be able to tap into these through the ARKit, CoreML and HomeKit platforms.Wood says: \"The focus on iOS11 was immense and necessary in the face of growing pressure from Google’s Android.”Jeff Orr, Research Director, Strategic Technologies, ABI Research, identifies the machine learning capabilities as a key announcement and a way to offer smartphone users more personalised experiences.He says: \"The Apple example [at the show] of being able to assemble a photo and video montage of a family pet is practical today because of the cloud services operating behind the scenes.Similarly, the presence of virtual digital assistants (Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, Bixby, etc.) are primitive today; forms of a voice front-end for web searches.\"With machine learning, entire custom experiences personalized to the user that perform activities and tasks become possible.",
        "Understanding context and intent from a voice input, powered by machine learning, make this a reality.\"As Orr notes, Apple is far from the only company to be playing in this space.",
        "Wood says: \"In the case of Google and Amazon these technologies are also the cornerstone of future revenues giving an enhanced understanding of their consumers needs and wants allowing ever more targeted (and therefore more lucrative) advertising opportunities.\"Apple's WWDC comes soon after Google's own developer jamboree, which was more open and vocal about its future plans than the iPhone maker's comparatively controlled public approach, much looser than in Steve Jobs' days but still rather secretive.Wood says: \"Google was happy to lay out a long term vision for its efforts in artificial intelligence, machine learning and more whereas Apple was much more circumspect – teasing WWDC attendees with some hints at plans in this area but continuing to maintain tight control over its platform.\"Furthermore Apple’s approach to customer data as part ‘differential privacy’ strategy is completely different to Google approach.",
        "Google, Amazon and others are using all the data generated by consumers using their services to optimise and refine its future artificial intelligence capabilities.",
        "Apple’s alternative approach of limiting the flow of consumer data from devices and deleting Siri data after six months could put it at a significant disadvantage in future.\"Ryan Reith, Program Vice President, Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, IDC, adds: \"I would say they have a lot of similar focuses, but of course Apple is trying to make their developer story focus on Apple hardware, whereas Google seems to be taking a much broader industry support approach.\"The way the launch of Apple’s HomePod connected speaker was discussed at WWDC gives an interesting, and perhaps unintended, glimpse into how Siri is faring, according to ABI's Orr.He says: \"Apple spent a good portion of the HomePod introduction discussing its approach as a music and audio experience company.",
        "This was done to not compare HomePod to Amazon Echo and Google Home products that cost significantly less.\"While the Amazon and Google devices focus on engaging with the platform using voice, this was clearly not a primary value on HomePod.",
        "It leaves us wondering if Siri is not a satisfactory interface solution for the home music experience, or if this was simply Apple attempting to not be called out for following existing vendors and products into the marketplace.\"Apple may have lacked the ability to truly surprise for some time now, but it does not matter when weekend reports suggest the company will break through the $1 trillion barrier in revenues derived from the iPhone since its launch a decade ago.Woods notes that Apple gave “few clues” on what we can expect from the upcoming iPhone 8.He says: \"Expectations are running at unprecedentedly high levels for this 10th anniversary update to the iPhone and Apple will need to deliver something special to give iPhone owners clear reasons to upgrade from existing iPhones.\"However, the analysts say the focus of WWDC was to give an indication of where the future revenues are coming from.",
        "The developed world is moving on, but not away, from the smartphone and Apple wants to be at the forefront of this new business. IDC's Reith says: \"I think all WWDC announcements have been strong, but because they are more about laying groundwork for future app developments they seem less sexy as a hardware announcement. Things like HomeKit, ARKit, etc are bit platform initiatives that will be a part of Apple strategy for quite some time.\""

        "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- It wound up not being as pretty as it could've been and it required a spark from some different faces, but LSU turned things around Saturday.",
        "And no matter how harrowing it might've gotten in the closing minutes, there was still an audible sigh of relief as the Tigers walked off the court at South Carolina.LSU broke up a back-and-forth battle with the young and feisty Gamecocks by cranking up its defense from start to finish and finding some timely touch from 3-point range in a 71-68 victory at the Colonial Life Center.The Tigers (10-4, 1-1 SEC) weathered a late charge from USC (7-8, 0-2), which scored 9 unanswered points after falling behind by 14 points to claw within 64-59 with 2:12 to go.Survival became the key after that, and LSU did by making just enough free throws - 7 of 13 in the last 1:10 - and not letting up defensively or on the backboards, where the Tigers seized 42-32 advantage.\"It was a grinding game,\" LSU coach Johnny Jones after his team avoided an 0-2 SEC start for the second year in a row.\"I thought it was a great team effort.\"A different-looking team for sure.Following a 68-50 blowout loss to Tennessee last Tuesday, Jones spent the week tweaking his team and making players re-establish their roles.",
        "The result was a new-look starting five, with senior Shavon Coleman and sophomore Malik Morgan stepping in for Jarell Martin and Andre Stringer.Those two combined for LSU's first 9 points and were also tone-setters on defense and on the backboards.Late in the game, Morgan connected on 2-of-4 foul shots in the last 22.9 seconds to finally secure the victory.",
        "Carolina's Brenton Williams hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer for the final difference.The loss snapped a two-game swoon and put the Tigers in the SEC win column for the first time this season.\"It was a little early to say this was a must-win for us,\" said Morgan, who scored 8 points, snatched 6 rebounds, recorded a team-high 4 assists and even blocked a pair of shots.",
        "\"But we also knew it was big for us to get headed back in the right direction.\"Martin led LSU with a career-best 18 points, and the inside tandem of Johnny O'Bryant and Jordan Mickey came alive in the second half with 9 and 8 points, respectively.Getting that inside duo revved up was what finally triggered the burst when the Tigers grabbed control.Eight minutes into the second half, the game was deadlocked, 42-42 as both teams grappled with turnovers and poor shooting - a result of stingy defense on both ends of the floor.Right after Williams made a pair of free throws, LSU's backcourt players started feeding the two big men inside.Morgan fed Mickey on a back-in move when he simply overpowered South Carolina's Michael Carerra.",
        "Then O'Bryant scored on a nice baseline drive. Mickey grabbed a pass from O'Bryant on a high-low feed and scored inside. Moments later, the talented freshman swished a jumper from the lane.",
        "And finally, O'Bryant finished off a 10-3 haymaker by facing up and nailing a 12-foot shot.\"It's good when we have that kind of success because it opens things up for Andre and Shavon on the outside,\" said Mickey, who scored 13 points, buoyed by 6-of-10 shooting from the floor.\"Did it ever.With the Gamecocks unable to contain Mickey and O'Bryant (13 points, 4-of-9 FG, 7 rebounds), Carolina coach Frank Martin put his team in a 2-3 zone - which made sense because the Tigers were 2-of-12 from 3-point range at that point.Finally, though, LSU's shooters connected from deep to complete the turnaround.Stringer sprinted to the left corner on a set play, gathered in a spot-on pass from Morgan and jacked in a trey to give the Tigers their first double-digit lead, 55-45 with 8:10 to go.",
        "Moments later, O'Bryant handled a double-team perfectly and fed Tim Quarterman and Stringer on back-to-back possessions for 3-pointers to swell the lead to 63-50 and the Gamecocks never climbed completely back.Not that they faded quietly in front of a spirited crowd of 12,071.After falling into a 64-50 hole, Carolina kept chipping away - aided by LSU's inability to hit shots from point-blank range and from the foul stripe.",
        "The Tigers went 4:34 between scoring and didn't make a shot from the field in the last 6:01.Meanwhile, Sindarius Thornwell kept attacking and scored 4 of his season-high 25 points to fuel the 9-0 surge. Moments later, Williams buried a 3-pointer to slice the Tigers' lead to 66-62 with 54 seconds to play.Unlike several games earlier this season, LSU held on, this time with sticky defense and offensive rebounding as the difference-maker.",
        "Mickey and Morgan came up with two of the Tigers' 14 steals in the closing minute and O'Bryant corralled a pair of key offensive caroms on missed free throws.\"We weren't great offensively after we got the big lead,\" Jones said. \"Shots didn't go, but we were able to make it up on the other end of the floor with hustle plays on defense and getting stops when we needed them.\"Which added up to what LSU needed most of all.\"We had to get back on the right path,\" Coleman said.",
        "\"We're too talented and have too many goals to reach to not play better than win games.\"The Tigers are back in action Wednesday when they travel to Ole Miss.New-look lineup lights the fuse earlyBOX SCORE: LSU 71, South Carolina 68"

        "As a nutrition-savvy clean eater, you probably think packaged foods are the devil. Sure, there are some not-so-bad options out there, but for the most part anything that comes in a box or bag is full of preservatives, added sugar, and WTF ingredients you would never want near your face.But imagine that you lived in a place with no refrigerator or freezer, and you had no access to a grocery store stocked with your favorite fresh fruits and veggies.",
        "In that case, you pretty much have to rely on packaged foods even if you're one of the healthiest, fittest people on the planet.For astronauts living on the International Space Station, this is a daily reality.MORE: Is Your Healthy Food Actually Radioactive?The only food aboard the ISS is like packaged foods on steroids. We're talking vacuum-sealed, sterilized, dehydrated, and powdered nuggets of nutritional goodness.",
        "Other than the no refrigeration problem, space food has to be as light as possible to keep mission costs low—the heavier the rocket, the more fuel it takes to launch.And it's no surprise that cosmic adventurers probably aren't stuffing their faces with packaged foods while planted on Earth. It takes 18 months of grueling physical and mental training to be qualified to leave Earth's bounds.",
        "Anyone who can make it through that is used to eating their Greek yogurt, lean protein, fruits, and veggies.But as disgusting as freeze-dried shrimp cocktail may seem, astronaut packaged food isn't as nutritionally defunct as most boxes and bags you pluck from grocery store shelves.NASA employs a team of highly trained food scientists to develop meals that will keep astronauts strong on their journeys, some of which last 6 months or longer.",
        "Of particular concern are sodium and iron intakes.Living in microgravity (because as any true space nerd knows, \"zero-gravity\" doesn't actually exist) leaves astronauts with a continuous stuffy nose, making foods high in salt and other spices more appealing to their drowsy tastebuds, Vickie Kloeris, NASA's manager of food systems for the ISS, told Smithsonian Magazine.Floating through the cosmos also affects astronauts' red blood cell counts, meaning they need less iron than those of us on Earth.",
        "Both too much iron and too much sodium can lead to health problems like bone loss and toxicity.MORE: Watch This: Astronaut Makes Tacos in SpaceAfter astronauts choose their menus (about 5 months before the planned launch), food scientists and nutritionists like Kloeris analyze their selections for optimal nutrition content to avoid those problems and make recommendations to fill any holes.Foods like dehydrated mac and cheese and thermally stabilized barbeque brisket fill those holes.",
        "And even though they might not sound appealing, modern-day astronauts are lucky compared to those who explored the cosmos at the beginning of the space program. Instead of sucking pureed bananas from a tube, today's astronauts choose delicacies like tacos, burgers, and peanut butter and honey sandwiches, which have all been heated to temperatures that kill bacteria and then packaged in airtight pouches.",
        "It's essentially like eating all of your food out of a flexible can.But the future of space food is looking even brighter, with fresh produce now completely possible.",
        "Astronauts aboard the ISS—including Scott Kelly, the first American astronaut to spend an entire year on the station—recently grew and ate lettuce in space for the first time.The lettuce was grown using red, blue, and green LED lights, similar to the way vertical farming works.An earlier crop was flown back to Earth and tested to make sure the leafy greens were safe for human consumption.",
        "And after the lettuce was given the green light, all systems are a go for future space farming.So, before long, astronauts could be eating just like we do—packaged foods be damned."

The attacks usually assume severalforms, including, inter alia, stabbing with a knife or a similar sharptool, hitting with a metal object, running over soldiers or settlers usingvehicles (vehicular attacks).",

Palestiniansare also subject to draconian punishments and reprisals includinghome-demolitions, land confiscation, stringent restrictions on travelmovement, and denial of employment opportunities as well as flagrantincarceration for years without charge or trial.",
        "Recently, theIsraeli political-establishment started setting messianic Jewish settlersto attack Palestinian civilians.",
        "Israel denies instructingsettlers to carry out \"dirty acts\" against Palestinians, including settingPalestinian homes on fire, burning mosques and churches as well asterrorizing Palestinian civilians and vandalizing their property.However, the relentless persistence of Jewish terrorist acts in the WestBank leaves no doubt as to the collusion and implicit coordination betweenthe paramilitary settlers and the military establishment.",
        "The new(old) reign of terror campaign has resulted in some Nazi-like incidents,including the burning to death of a Palestinian toddler, Ali Dawabshe, andhis father at the village of Duma, south of Nablus, about two weeks ago.Israel has utterly failed to put an end to such criminal acts assettlers feel well protected by the security establishment as well as bythe brazenly biased justice system which itself is heavily infiltrated bysettlers and their sympathizers.",
        "Needless to say, this heavyhanded oppression of a people languishing under a harsh occupation fordecades serves to narrow Palestinian horizons. It generates a lot of rage,frustration and a burning desire for revenge. It also pushes Palestinianyoungsters, both men and women, to the edge. Hence, the lone-wolfincidents. The bulk of Palestinians, like all people under thesun, love and value life.",
        "Claiming otherwise is illogical and dishonest.However, when life becomes an enduring and unrelenting nightmare, asis often under the Israeli occupation, many Palestinians, especiallyyoungsters, don't hesitate to harbor second thoughts. That is why,Israeli criminality is first and foremost to blame for the desperate actscarried out by desperate people whose lives have been crushed tosmithereens by the evil acts and policies of the Israeli state.",
        "Infact, we can argue with very little exaggeration that the lone-wolfattacks against Israeli targets are the inevitable \"effects\" orside-effects of Israel's long-established policy against the Palestinianpeople, a policy whose ultimate goal is to force as many Palestinians aspossible to leave their ancestral homeland. I am not eager to hurlthe Nazi epithets at Jews. However, when Jews think, behave and act likethe Nazis did, we should never hesitate for a moment to call the spade aspade.",
        "Yes, Israel is not shipping Palestinians to concentrationcamps. But Israel is killing Palestinian by other means. Israel is alsotormenting Palestinians in a variety of ways, including blockading theirpopulation centers and denying them basic human rights and civilliberties.Needless to say, I can provide a thousand examples tocorroborate my argument. Lone-wolf operations can be preventedTrue, it is next to impossible to prevent lone-wolf operations fromhappening.",
        "In the final analysis, one cannot prevent a person so intent ondying from dying. Moreover, it is well-established that suchindividuals have deep grievances which they can't reconcile with, as manyof them have gone through the painful experience of seeing their relativesmurdered before their eyes, or watching their homes blown up or demolishedinto bits and pieces by indifferent Israeli soldiers.",
        "Sometimes,when the level of oppression reach a certain high level, concern for lifeby the victims becomes a secondary factor. This is the reality that theIsraeli establishment chooses to ignore due to its insolence,recalcitrance and arrogance of power. As mentioned above, noPalestinian takes his life cheaply. No Palestinian is eager to consignhimself or herself to the hereafter for disingenuous reasons.However, when life becomes worse than death, death becomes a dear andsought-after wish.",
        "None the less, Palestinian youngsters can bedissuaded from embarking on individual attacks, which pop up into one'shead at the spur of the moment, if Israel starts treating Palestinianswith a modicum of respect and humanity. Introducing a level ofcivility and decency into Israel's treatment of the Palestinians wouldcost Israel absolutely nothing. On the contrary, it would spareIsraeli lives as well as Palestinian lives.

        "Monday Morning Manager 2011, Edition 9This week: MIN (5/30-6/1); at CWS (6/3-5)So, What Happened?MMM looks at last week's record, sees 3-3, and shakes his head, because it didn't \"feel\" like a .500 week.",
        "It felt much, much worse.Let's start with losing three straight to the Red Sox over the weekend, which only accentuated why MMM doesn't believe our Motor City Kitties are ready for prime time.Then there was the strange Scott Sizemore trade, and the demotion of Ryan Perry and the handing of the 2B job to Ryan Freaking Raburn.All that, and yet the Tigers played .500 for the week.",
        "Go figure.The week began with a pair of victories over hot Tampa Bay, if you can remember that far back, because everything described above happened after the Rays left town.The Tigers also lost an opportunity to gain ground on the Indians, who have lost four of five.Hero of the WeekMMM is tempted to give the honor to young lefty Andy Oliver, who pitched well in his 2011 debut on Sunday.But it's tough to go against Justin Verlander after what he did on Sunday night in the DH nightcap.The Tigers were semi-reeling, looking like they were about to go off on another of those long losing streaks (it was at three and looking ominous) and be swept in four games at home to Boston, when Verlander came to the rescue.JV shut the Bosox down, throwing a career-high 132 pitches and allowing zero, zip, nada runs.He did what he had to do, when he had to do it---especially given the Tigers' popgun offense.Anyone else want to argue that Max Scherzer, not JV, is the Tigers' ace?Goat of the WeekMMM can't understand, nor stomach, manager Jim Leyland's stubbornness.Why he continues to bat the consistent Jhonny Peralta and Alex Avila in the lower third of a batting order that is on life support is beyond MMM's comprehension.MMM says top load the order with Austin Jackson, Peralta, Avila, Miggy Cabrera and Victor Martinez and see what happens.Then Leyland declared that Raburn was his everyday second baseman on Friday night, and said the season for RR \"starts tomorrow.\"Well, on Opening Day, Raburn did his usual strikeout boogie, and ended Sunday's first game by being emasculated by Jonathan Papelbon on three pitches.MMM is making Leyland the goat for his refusal to shake up a batting order that badly needs it.MMM is tired of seeing the likes of Don Kelly and Andy Dirks (no offense, kid) in the two and three holes.Under the MicroscopeThis week it's not a player, per se, who's UtM, but an entire position.While you could make a case that that position ought to be 2B, MMM is putting 3B UtM.This is because suddenly there's a pseudo platoon going on at the hot corner, with Brandon Inge and Kelly taking turns, against lefties and righties, respectively.Inge told the media the other day, \"I think (sitting out the last two games) was a way to get me fired up and to bear down.\"After which Inge promptly went out and put on another couple of feeble offensive displays.Neither Inge nor Kelly can hit.",
        "Kelly's RBI single late in Sunday's nightcap was just his THIRD ribbie of the season---and Don's been on the roster since Opening Day!!Eyes should be trained on 2B, too, because there may be a trade a-comin'.But for now, let's focus our attention on 3B and see what plays out there. Why? Because MMM is a masochist!Upcoming: Twins and White SoxThe 17-34 Twins invade CoPa for three games. The Tigers must make sure the Twinkies leave town at least 18-36.That's all MMM is going to say about that series.",
        "Nothing more needs to be said.As for the White Sox, they've been showing some life lately, though they're still \"scuffling,\" as Rod Allen would say.The Tigers, for whatever reason, have owned the Chisox in a winning streak over the South Siders that goes back to last season. MMM has lost track of how many games in a row the Tigers have won between the two teams, but it's a lot.Will the streak continue through the upcoming weekend?You'll never get MMM to put a bet down where the Tigers are concerned.",
        "They're more unpredictable than a woman choosing a pair of shoes.That's all for this week's MMM. See you next week!Labels: Monday Morning Manager"

        "Since 1792, the Scotia Bar has been sitting in Stockwell St, providing a drink, a good blether, and all forms of entertainment for the denizens of Glasgow and those who pass through the city. Back in the pub’s early days, the nearby river Clyde was a busy thoroughfare, as Glasgow was a growing port. Additionally, the Scotia was near the last ferry stage on the Clyde, the Tolbooth and the local gallows.",
        "So between all that, it’s fair to say that the Scotia was, to use local parlance, ‘fair hoachin’ (very busy), with people nipping in for a quick libation or so whilst going about their business. The theatrical was added to this eclectic mix with the new Scotia Variety and Music Hall, later the Metropole, opening next door in 1862.There are a number of ghosts to be found at the pub, according to paranormal groups who have investigated it.",
        "Perhaps the best known of these is the ghost of a manager who hung himself there during the 1970s, mentioned by Martin Coventry in his guide to haunted Scotland. This was kept very hushed up at the time according to current manager Mary, to the extent that even the regulars wouldn’t have known. Shania, medium with paranormal group Spirit Finders, described him in a 2007 investigation, a report of which subsequently appeared in The Scotsman.",
        "Shania stated that the bar was a second home to the man in life, but something got too much, so he hung himself in the cellar Mary remembered Shania felt as though she was choking when she set foot in the cellar. Prior to Shania’s visit, another medium going down to the cellar couldn’t breathe and grabbed her throat.Scottish Paranormal held an investigation in The Scotia in July 2007.",
        "Further contact was made with the late manager’s ghost by the group medium, Ewan, who sensed the ghost walking up and down the back section of the bar. A lot of activity had been noted by the fireplace, so the group decided to hold a vigil here towards the end of their investigation, Ewan again sensed with the ghost, describing him as having swollen ankles and bruising above both ankles. However, unlike the other mediums, Ewan didn’t detect much in the cellar.",
        "Incidentally, he also detected a male spirit with rope burn and missing teeth who had been hanged, wandering the area by the fireplace. It’s unclear if this was the same ghost as the 1970s manager. Given that the public Gallows were nearby, it could be someone else altogether!Other male spirits detected by Ewan that night include a man who had died from a puncture wound to the chest from a knife. This was a ghost going back a few years, described by Ewan as ‘podgy, not tall’.",
        "Ewan also sensed the ghost of a wee boy, aged about 9 or 10 years old looking for his mother, The boy was described by Ewan as having light brown hair and trousers tucked into his long socks, A smart young lad, it was felt he was well liked, but was very shy. Additionally, Ewan sensed the spirit of the child of a former manager.",
        "Interestingly enough, the Scotia’s website mentions that the ghost of the original owner’s child can be seen running in and out the door, Ewan picked up the names Daniel and Paul, and the surname Galbraith as being associated with the building.However, contrary to the history of the Glasgow pub as the male domain, it seems that women outnumber the men in the ghostly sense at the Scotia.",
        "Mary Rafferty told me of a former barmaid who had worked at the Scotia who told Mary about a ‘Green Lady’ who walks the bar, and will walk by people. The barmaid said this ghost had been seen by customers. Shania of Spirit Seekers picked up on her, describing her as a lady in a green velvet dress and a poke bonnet. This is also one of the ghosts mentioned on the pub website.",
        "Mary mentioned that a regular called Jimmy claims to have seen the Green Lady, on top of ghosts he had seen in the snug, though this appeared to coincide with mention of another paranormal group coming to visit! The Glasgow banter leaves no stone unturned.There you have the ghosts, but what of the activity? On a day to day basis, Mary Rafferty says that not much ghostly activity gets reported to her.",
        "A self confessed skeptic, Mary has experienced some things during the aforementioned paranormal investigations which she can’t quite explain. For instance, there was the fun had by Annie, the 20th century prostitute mentioned above, during the Spirit Finders investigation, The group were holding a seance using a glass, and asked Annie to do something extraordinary – the glass then started racing around the table, much to Mary’s amazement.",
        "The group also got pictures of orbs in the snug, something which the accompanying newspaper photographer couldn’t explain. Paranormal Scotland managed to record an EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) of a male (perhaps the 1970s suicide?) aggressively saying, ‘Get out of my pub.’In what turned out to be quite a colourful night for Scottish Paranormal, they also had some interesting results in an experiment on temperature control.",
        "They had brought along two miniatures, Jack Daniels and Bailey’s respectively. Holding thermometers to each bottle, they asked a ghost to choose which bottle he/she preferred. The temperature by the Bailey’s went down by 6 degrees – discerning taste perchance?Amongst other phenomenon reported by the two teams, one of the investigators of Spirit Finders saw a ‘dark shadow’ cross the bar at 3.35 am.",
        "And Ewen of Paranormal Scotland heard a round of applause near the fireplace – harking back to the Metropole days perhaps?So, go to the Scotia and you might get more than a quiet drink, or a night of creative writing and folk music? It does seem rather fitting that another paranormal group meet up in the bar once a month, and who have in fact carried out some of their own investigations.",
        "Who knows what Annie might have up her sleeve for them one evening!Thanks to Mary Rafferty for taking the time out of running a busy pub to tell a few ghost stories!So what’s this then?Sources:Coventry, Martin, Haunted Places of Scotland Second Edition, Goblinshead, 2009Spirit Finders Scotsman ReportParanormal Scotland: Investigation Report (Supplied by Mary Rafferty)Scotia Bar Official Website History PageExplore Glasgow Website:Interview with Mary Rafferty 18/8/2012"

        "Cedar Fair's 22-year winning streak of providing cash distributions to investors ended last year.It's time to begin a new streak, the company's biggest investor says.Q Funding, the Texas-based investor that owns about 18 percent of Cedar Fair's outstanding units, has written a letter to Cedar Fair's board urging the company to immediately resume cash distributions to unitholders and to pay at least 50 cents per unit.The company, which made its letter public by filing it with the Securities and Exchange Commission, is asking other unitholders to join its call to resume the cash distribution.\"We believe a minimum of a $0.50 distribution is not only possible but also an absolute necessity and should be begun as soon as possible.",
        "The company owes this to the unitholders, many of whom made their investments based upon the distribution and who also need it to pay their taxes related to this investment,\" the Q Funding letter stated.\"The company has projected its Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to be $320 to $340 million during 2010, which very closely compares to 2007 EBITDA of $340 million, a year when it distributed $1.90 per unit.And the debt at the company as of year-end 2009 was actually lower than the debt level at the end of 2007 by close to $125 million,\" it stated.\"Put simply, it is hard to understand why the company could not make at minimum a $0.50 distribution per unit this year when it is projected to generate similar EBITDA and has less debt than in 2007 when it made a $1.90 distribution per unit.",
        "In our view, a very reasonable argument could also be made for a $1 distribution based on the company's own dividend history and relative performance,\" it continued.Dick Kinzel, Cedar Fair's president, chief executive officer and chairman, said earlier this week that dealing with Cedar Fair's $1.6 billion of debt must be a top priority.He said Wednesday he believes it makes sense for the company to consider resuming the distribution later this year, after it knows whether it had a successful season.\"We respect the opinion of all of our investors,\" he said.",
        "\"We appreciate their interests and concerns.\"The Q Funding letter brings up the debt issue.\"We understand that you may also desire to reduce debt, but we believe a $0.50 to $1 distribution would leave at least $60 million to $30 million of cash flow available to pay down debt based upon the company's public statements during the most recent investor conference call.",
        "This would still leave the company with less debt than it would have had under the board-approved Apollo Global Management buyout, which you and the management team were presumably comfortable with,\" it stated.Randy Hunt, branch manager of Sandusky's Stifel Nicolaus office, said Q Funding's effort is \"extremely positive\" news for his many customers who own Cedar Fair units.\"If they put any dividend back in, it would make so many shareholders happy,\" he said.",
        "\"It would show light at the end of the tunnel.\"Q Funding III and a related company, Q4 Funding, own 18 percent of Cedar Fair's units. Both companies are controlled by Geoffrey Raynor, a Fort Worth investment banker.Q Funding helped lead opposition to Apollo Global Management's plan to take over Cedar Fair. More recently, it persuaded Cedar Fair to agree to add two independent new members to its board."

        "By Zahira Torres / El Paso TimesEl Paso TimesArea educators, health-care professionals and lawyers gathered Saturday to discuss a decision by the county attorney's office to seek a tougher punishment for a 16-year-old El Paso girl accused of trying to smuggle cocaine into the U.S.\"Our correctional system is so imperfect,\" said Cristina Cruz-Grost, a child psychiatrist and forensic expert. \"We need to come together to educate and rehabilitate people who go through the system.",
        "É To place a 16-year-old in the correctional department of Texas with up to a 40-year sentence erases the potential for rehabilitation and destroys her life.\"The Ysleta district student, whose name was withheld because she is a juvenile, was allegedly caught trying to smuggle nearly 50 pounds of cocaine into the U.S.",
        "The street value of the cocaine is estimated to be between $280,000 and $700,000, officials said.Last week, a grand jury, at the request of the county attorney's office, decided to allow the teen to be tried under the Texas Determinate Sentencing statute.Under the statute, the juvenile faces the possibility of a sentence of up to 40 years in juvenile detention facilities and in adult.According to statistics from the Juvenile Probation Department, eight minors have been detained at the bridge in the past seven years for carrying up to 200 grams of a controlled substance, other than marijuana.",
        "During the same period, six others have been detained for carrying more than 200 grams of a controlled substance, other than marijuana.Panelists Saturday said the figures are not enough to prove the need for determinate sentencing.\"I have to wonder if this was politically motivated,\" said Samuel Schmidt, a political science professor at the Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez.\"It seems that they are not really trying to rehabilitate if they are trying to sentence a 16-year-old to 40 years in prison.",
        "Did she do something wrong? Yes. Should she be punished? Yes. But to what extent?\"Elhiu Dominguez, the county attorney's office spokesman, said that the decision to prosecute under the Texas Determinate Sentencing statute does not necessarily mean that the office is trying for a 40-year sentence.Instead, he said, the statute allows a jury the flexibility to punish the juvenile past her 21st birthday, under provisions that include prison time, probation or parole.",
        "If a minor is prosecuted in a non-determinate sentencing case, punishment would not extend beyond the age of 21, he said.\"We simply wanted to give jurors an option for a wider sentence,\" Dominguez said. \"Our emphasis is not on incarcerating juveniles but on rehabilitating them.\"The teenager's trial, originally set for Monday, has been rescheduled for 8:30 a.m. Oct. 30 in the 65th District Court.",
        "Dominguez could not verify whether the teenager has a lawyer.Wednesday, September 27, 2006Panelists say 40-year term harsh for girl, 16 in TexasPosted bykdsmoothat9:42 AMLabels: Racism,<<"

        "It’s Beltane today, an ancient pagan festival of fertility and growth, celebrated on the 1st May. What a lovely time of year to be out in the fresh air, and wandering around ancient fenland… the Trust’s wonderful Askham Bog, one of my ‘luckiest’ reserves.Lucky because in my many visits over the years I’ve had some fabulous sightings there: willow tits, bullfinches, treecreepers, roe deer, water shrew, several different dragonfly species, and many more.",

        "Unlike things with legs and wings, plants and flowers obligingly stay in one place!This visit however I’m here as part of my work on well-being via the natural world; facilitating a small group having some quiet time in nature, interspersed with questions and discussion on how nature impacts on our sense of well-being.",
        "With picnic time afterwards, of course: even the most mundane lunchtime sandwich tastes better when eaten outside in the spring sunshine.I arrive before our agreed meet up time so I can prepare myself, mentally, and just be alone to breathe in the delicious air: and, to use that standard birding and wildlifing phrase - to see what’s about.What’s about first up is a perky robin.",
        "Someone has left some dried mealworms on a fence post - it’s a favourite spot for photographers, I know, so perhaps one was here even earlier than me. In which case, the early photographer caught the bird… with the worm. ‘My’ robin whips in, picks one up and whips out again as I pass very close by. Although I really enjoy more isolated nature reserves, one of the lovely things about more populated ones is that the birds become very used to people being about, and are less timid.",
        "Or, to use another birding word: more confiding. Though I’ve yet to have a robin whisper his secrets in my ear.Askham is a great reserve for anyone with mobility issues, or who uses a wheelchair or scooter, because you can stay on the boardwalk, safe and dry, and still experience plenty of nature’s bounty. I have to admit though that I love going ‘off-piste’, and there are wonderful wilder (and wetter!) parts of the reserve to explore.I step over a stile, and move away from the designated walk.",
        "Within seconds, there’s the feeling I have so often in the natural world: I lose that sense of I, that sense of who and what I am; of what’s going on in my little life, and sort of meld in with everything around me. What the poet Wordsworth describes as “a sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused”.",
        "This notion of ‘becoming one’ with nature, or ‘communing’ with it, can seem a bit strange to many people, but for others (and more of us have experienced this during our enforced local lockdown walks) it can be a calming and healing process. As well as the intellectual joys of just getting to learn more about our own natural environment.One of my group today, for example, is surprised to discover that catkins are not just from one kind of tree!",
        "They had a vague notion from childhood of them being called ‘pussy willows’ and they’re fascinated to find out there are hazel, alder, oak, and a variety of willows all present at Askham, each with their distinctive catkins.",
        "They enjoy the experience of touching and smelling the different catkins - though perhaps not the best activity for those sensitive to tree pollen!In the ‘highlights of the morning’ discussion before our picnic lunch, people talk about the species they enjoyed seeing, especially for the first time.",
        "Wren - “how can such a small bird make such a big noise??” - was one surprise; treecreeper - “should be tree-spiraller” - was another; and a pair of very close-up roe deer was exciting for someone else who’d only ever seen them from a train.They comment too on less tangible aspects: being soothed by the sound of breezes in the reeds; feeling more alert and in-the-moment; more respectful of surroundings; experiencing more acutely different sensory inputs; and so on.",
        "For me, much as I love my lone wanderings in nature, it’s such a joy to be with others experiencing nature in a deeper way than they have before, whether from a cognitive or an emotional perspective.But nature does have its little irritating behaviours and, just as we settle on the bench at the dragonfly pond for lunch, the rain descends. And in the proverbial bucketsful. So no picnic in the spring sunshine after all, but otherwise a most satisfying excursion."

        "Showcasing works that delve into this period of societal transformations, which saw the rapid development of China’s entertainment industry, athletics, and urban infrastructure, the show investigated how individuals navigated the balancing act between their own identities and that of collective society amid such shifts.The center of the gallery accommodated works that explore theatricality.",
        "New Neighbour (2019), Li Ran’s newly commissioned installation, is an open, two-level stage, replete with inbuilt staircases and props such as a mop, trashcan, and coat. In the absence of performers, Li invites viewers to take the stage and act out his script. Adapted from He Jiping’s 1984 drama Good Fortune Building, Li’s play includes a series of domestic conflicts that occur within a building in Hong Kong.",
        "While He’s script argues that the city’s adoption of capitalism led to alienation and inequality among its people, Li investigates the differences between individuals, and the frustrations that the households in this building share. He allows participants to embody the perspectives of different characters, and thus closely consider the dynamics of capitalist societies. Another immersive work was Yao Qingmei’s three-channel video installation Molt (Body Inspection) (2017).",
        "In the left projection, a female dancer performs a striptease, while a security officer—symbolizing censorship—enacts robotic movements as part of what is meant to be a “security check” on the right.",
        "The screen in the middle shows a choir—similar to the chorus in Greek plays—solemnly singing the line “Big Brother is watching you.” During a pause, the performers across all three screens stare at the audience, creating a sealed, panoptic environment where the viewer is scrutinized by the collective.The body was further foregrounded in works concerned with sports. Clustered in one section of the gallery, these artworks probe how individuals wrestle against uniformity.",
        "Xin Yunpeng’s two-channel video installation documents a group of secondary school students practicing boxing during an annual military training camp, while Gao Lei highlights the vulnerability of the body by fashioning parallel bars used in gymnastics—often a part of military exercises—out of the nylon material that is used to make prosthetic limbs, in G-350 (2013). Both works reflect on how an individual’s body can be disciplined for a specific function through repeated training.",
        "In the same section, Wang Bo’s installation shifted the focus to the internal struggle of an athlete. The Orbit (2019) recreates the Los Angeles hotel room that the professional tennis player Hu Na was staying in while competing for the 1982 Federation Cup. During the tournament, Hu decided to leave the national team and seek political asylum in the United States.",
        "Wang’s installation delineates how Hu’s freedom was gained through her departure from the orbit of the collective, at the cost of her never being able to return home.The displays at the gallery’s opposite end examined how individuals have made personal spaces for themselves within the nation’s landscapes. Chen Wei’s An Advertisement About the Future (2019) depicts the clichéd slogan “Building Your Future,” seen in numerous real-estate advertisements.",
        "The installation was juxtaposed with Chen’s “S” (2018), a photo of a spiral staircase in a partially deconstructed Beijing building. The decrepit scene is a reminder of how property developers fail to fulfil people’s expectations of a better life, and instead build lies and illusions. Also commenting on failed promises for the future are South Ho Siu Nam’s photos of Hong Kong’s 2014 Umbrella Movement, when peaceful protests for universal suffrage were ignored by the city’s governors.",
        "Depicting helmets, water bottles, and rolls of tissues on the street, but no people, the images convey the insignificance of individuals within the fabric of society.Through explorations of body and space, and how they collide and interact with each other, “The Racing Will Continue, The Dancing Will Stay” evinced the responses of individuals to the collective ethos of a transformative time.."

        "22 --NEWS SUMMARYTeam Bush is darn good at the mechanics of modern international presidential travel.They herd the press corps; they create the photo ops; they manage the take-aways; they answer the questions the way they want them answered; they trot out smooth-as-butta Dan Bartlett; and they don't let the storyline get away from them.No less an Owl Eyes than CBS News Mark Knoller used the phrase \"tres bien\" with his flawless French accent!) on the radio this morning pertaining to thawing Franco-American relations, although he might as well have been speaking about the whole trip so far.And/but back here at home (as they say in the news dodge when they are trying to be transitional), the big game remains the President's Social Security overhaul vision.The Gang of 500 (and/including Republican members of the Congress) continue to propagate the CW that what constituents say to members during the current Capitol Hill recess (and what members are able to convince constituents to believe) will go a long way toward determining the fate of the reform effort.In fact, you don't need to get all that into the weeds of the tea leaves to say that many \"observers\" (read: \"participants\") see the first threshold as whether anything should be tried AT ALL -- and that comes before the questions of WHAT should be tried for and IF something can be passed in 2005.Stories from two of the leading political reporters on the 2004 presidential campaign tell the tale:The New York Times' Jodi Wilgoren writes about \"folding before the flop .",
        ". . \" LINKAnd Pat Healy (formerly of the Boston Globe but now also of the Times), wrote yesterday about a \"melancholy spell over the city.\" LINKNow, Wilgoren was writing about poker and Healy about TV shows set in New York, but you get our gist.Perhaps more on point: the Wall Street Journal today writes about intra-GOP divisions over taxes; personal-account-booster Rep. Paul Ryan doesn't seem all that optimistic; and Ways and Means point guy Rep.",
        "McCrery reveals a \"Sopranos\"-style sit-down with some Administration officials after he recently uttered a discouraging word -- and then closes his New York Times profile with some MORE discouraging words. (More on all this below.)So while the President -- pre-departure -- cast the Social Security mission as convincing people that there IS a problem, we see the bigger issue right now as convincing Republicans that, in the end, Social Security reform is going to happen.",
        "Because without that, the heavy lift becomes excessively Sisyphean.As both Peter Pan and Tug McGraw have said: You gotta believe.The Believer-in-Chief -- surely monitoring all these developments from overseas -- has a European day that is packed.By the time you read this, he has breakfasted with Blair; bi-lated with Berlusconi and met with Yushenko. At 10:45 am ET, he attends an EU meeting. He takes a class photo with EU leaders at 12:20 pm ET.",

        "Here, the officers pay no mind to my section, either oblivious or intentional, much in the way most customers are blind to the occasional cockroach that scurries up the wall out by the kitchen.During holiday season, and sometimes for no reason at all, I am bestowed with trinkets and treats – dangly earrings from a Yonge Street kiosk, a carton of Kent cigarettes, a packet of matches, its cover painted with dancing hula girls.Once, on my birthday, they bought me a heavenly piece of Fran’s mile-high lemon meringue pie.",
        "And when they sing ‘Happy Birthday,’ they harmonize, their voices melodic and tender, their serenade followed by hugging and kissing.I haven’t felt this loved since I last saw my mother.Many memories endure from those long-ago night shifts. Hands clasped over mouths, aghast or in playful hysteria. Heads huddled together in conspiratorial whisper. Sugar dispensers turned upside down over half-empty coffee cups, contents pouring out at length for comic effect.",
        "Voices raised in debate, sometimes in anger or resignation, and always a coming together.And I wonder – what became of them? Did they stay in the city? Who found love? After I had moved on, did they like the new waitress as much as they had liked me? Do they miss the old days? Who survived? Do they remember me in the way that I remember them?The very last shift I worked at Fran’s was a cold one, the snow blowing and bereft.",
        "I had switched for an earlier time slot, a farewell drink waiting for me at the Demimonde Colonial Tavern, a new life in the offing in Fredericton, New Brunswick. I felt compelled to find relatives who barely knew me, longing to shake off a tumbleweed future. My shift ended well before midnight. As I walked out into the darkness, I heard their siren song call out from the restaurant radio.‘Ground Control to Major Tom…’"

        "OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIATHE INDIAN MISSIONARYBy Luther F. AddingtonIt seems very strange indeed that an Indian boy would want tobecome a missionary among the white people. But there was such a boy.His name was Dale, and he belonged to the Mingo tribe which lived on theOhio River.Patrick Porter, who had a fort near Falling Branch on ClinchRiver, wentwith the Clinch Valley troops to fight Cornstalk at Point Pleasant in1774.",
        "One night after the troops were told they could go home, therecame to Patrick Porter's campfire the notorious Chief Logan. ChiefLogan, tall and reddish-brown, clad in a hunting coat, moccasins andleggins, tapped Patrick Porter on the shoulder and said,\"You are Patrick Porter. You live on Clinch River. I havebeen to your fort. Many times I could have killed you, but I would not.You good man. You good father to children who lived near yourfort.\"Patrick Porter reached out a hand.",
        "The Indian chief shook it.\"What can I do for you, Chief Logan?\" Patrick Porterasked.\"Much,\" said the chief. \"Not for me but for afriend of mine.\"\"What is it, Chief Logan?\"PatrickPorter held to his long rifle. A coon tail hanging from his cap flappedin the wind. The air was chill. Leaves rustled as they swept along overthe woodland floor. It was autumn. Out of the dark came an Indian boy.He was naked, save moccasins on his feet and a piece of deer skin abouthis loins. \"This is Dale,\" the Indian chief said.",
        "PatrickPorter shook hands with the boy. \"Glad to know you, Dale,\" hesaid. The boy merely grunted.The campfire crackled. A flame leaped up, lighting Dale's tiredface. Away in the woods an owl hooted. Chief Logan put a hand on PatrickPorter's shoulder again.\"White people kill all of Dale's family. Kill all his kin.Now he wants to go with white men and learn to read from their books. Hewants to preach the word of God.\"Patrick Porter was amazed.",
        "He said, \"The white people killyour relatives, yet you want to go and live with them?\"Dale nodded.\"He want to go with good whitepeople, like you, Captain Porter. And I know you are good. I pick you totake him.\"Patrick Porter stooped and threw a fresh stick of wood onto thefire. Sparks flew. Smoke twisted up in a spiral and was snatched by thewind.\"Chief Logan,\" Patrick Porter said, \"we whitepeople need to do some kind deed for your people because the whites havebeen cruel.",
        "Especially havethey been cruel to your people, Chief Logan.\"\"Uh! Very cruel,\" Chief Logan grunted. He folded hisarms across his big chest.\"Then Patrick Porter will take Dale?\"\"I should like very much to take him\" Patrick Porterreplied. He paused and leaned heavily on his gun. Then he added,\"But I am afraid to take him. The Mingoes are still angry with thewhite people. They willfollow me to my home and kill me for taking the boy.\"\"No, no!\" said Chief Logan, shaking his head.",
        "\"Wewill fix that someway.\"\"I'm afraid we can't,\" Patrick Porter said. \"Nowyou take him away before your tribesmen come. The war is over. Let'sspill no more blood.\"Chief Logan and the Indian boy went away into the woods. Thetrees seemed to cry. Patrick Porter felt bad. He lay down by the fire,but he could not sleep. He wondered whether Chief Logan would bringIndian braves and attack his camp.Early next morning Patrick Porter, lying near the campfire, heardthe leaves rustle.",
        "He leaped up, gun in hand, ready to shoot. But afterone close look he let the gun barrel drop. There before him stood theboy Dale, alone. In his hand was a scrap of paper. He reached it towardPatrick Porter who took it, turned to the firelight, and read in Englishwhichhe knew a white man had written. But to the note was Chief Logan'sname. The note read:\"Mr. Porter, I ask you again to take Dale. I have fixed itso Mingoes won't follow.",
        "I told them that Dale had been drowned in theriver while crossing.\"Patrick Porter shook his head.\"I cannot take you,\" he said. \"I tell you theMingoes will find you. They will kill me and all my people.\"The Indian boy reached out his hands, pleading. He did not speak.Patrick Porter's heart was touched too deeply for him to keep onsaying no.\"Very well,\" he finally said. \"I will let you go.I shall risk it.",
        "Now lie down here by the fire and rest.\"Dale traveled all the way to Clinch River with Patrick Porter andlived with him at the fort on Falling Branch near the river. He was ahappy lad, and he really tried to learn. Little by little he came tounderstand English words. Then he begged to be taught to read and write.Patrick Porter saw to it that he had a tutor.Patrick Porter was himself a student of the Bible, and heinterested the Indian boy in its stories.",
        "After a few years, Dale wasable to read for himself.\"You need more name than Dale,\" Patrick Porter told himone day. \"And I am giving you the name Arter. From now on you areArter Dale.\"\"Good,\" said Dale, thumping his youthful chest. \"Ilike the name Arter Dale.\"The boy grew to manhood, and there on Clinch River he married awhite girl. Today, many are the people who pride themselves in having intheir veins the blood of Arter Dale.Arter became a leader in his community.",
        "He became a convert toChristianity and later joinedthe Methodist Church. For many years heserved the Church as a minister preaching to the whitepeople along theriver valley.FOOTNOTES:Source: History of Scott County."

        "I was fortunate to grow up in southern Tasmania with parents who enjoyed the bush, the rivers and the sea. From about the age of three I was camping regularly in the sticks of the south-west wilderness. The coastline was always close to my heart – its sands, cliffs, blowholes and caves – and one of my favourite places was Cloudy Bay Lagoon on Bruny Island. Little did I know that by age 17 I’d be in a position to buy the land around it.",
        "I’d assumed a crystal-clear lagoon full of abalone, oysters and crayfish would be crown reserve but it was for sale as a rural block.When I was 12 I borrowed my dad’s dingy to go fishing so I could raise some pocket money through selling any fish I caught to people at Blackmans Bay and Kingston. I ended up earning $6,000 in 10 weeks, so I poached until I was old enough to get a fishing licence.",
        "I would often take my friends out with me on the boat and when I saw how blown away they were by the wildlife and scenery, including the southern hemisphere’s tallest sea cliffs, I started thinking about catching people instead of fish.In 1999 I started Bruny Island Cruises, which would eventually become Pennicott Wilderness Journeys. I personally took out 1,200 passengers that year, and made a $40,000 loss.",
        "The second year I made a bit, then the third year I was turning away more people than I could take. Today, still, 65 per cent of my passengers are Tasmanians fascinated by the environments on their doorstep. Awards for Tasmania’s top tourist attraction and excellence in sustainability has kept us busy, and our newest Seafood Seduction tour is going really well.",
        "We’ve tapped into commercial fishing quotas and the group size is limited to 10 to ensure we’re not harming the natural balance when we take our four abalone, crayfish or sea urchins.I established the Tasmanian Coast Conservation Fund with the Parks & Wildlife Service and Wildcare in 2007, and within three years we had eradicated the feral cats responsible for killing upward of 50,000 seabirds a year on Tasman Island.",
        "Whereas my tour guests used to take photos of cats with dead birds in their mouths, they’re now photographing birds that haven’t been seen on Tasman for 30 years.A few years later I started the Pennicott Foundation so I could pursue my passion for philanthropic work, with the guiding principle that not a single cent is spent on administration. We now have two foundations, which last year supported 236 projects ranging from beach clean-ups to school activity programs.",
        "I’m a believer in the idea that everyone can do a little to help, and would much rather spend my earnings on a project that could reap benefits for 10 more lifetimes than buy ‘stuff’.",
        "This week we collected seven bags of rubbish from one beach with the help of local schoolchildren, which doesn’t seem like much until you add it up over the year.My wife Michaye and I were lucky to be able to bring up our children Mia, now 15, and Noah, 13, on Bruny without iPhones and the nearest neighbour about four kilometres away.",
        "I used to take the kids on the boat when I was working and vividly remember holding Mia over the side when she was just two weeks old as a dolphin came up beneath her feet and rolled on to its side. On another of my most memorable tours I freed a seal that had become trapped in a fishing net and then watched it circle the boat about five times, leaping in the air as if to say thank-you. I turned around to see half the passengers balling their eyes out.",
        "We now have 76 staff across Bruny Island, Tasman Island and Hobart, but I still get out regularly and would work for nothing just to have a couple of experiences like that a year.In 2012 I had the idea of sailing an inflatable dingy round Australia as a way to raise awareness and funds to help eradicate polio, and when I told Michaye she just nodded “oh yes, sounds good”.",
        "I pulled out a little Jacaranda atlas – Australia didn’t look that big on there – and after a few drinks with my colleague Mick Souter we’d plotted a route on Google Earth. Three months later, our two 17-foot boats arrived – in hindsight they were too flat-bottomed for the journey – and we set off together with cameraman Zorro Gamarnik.",
        "There were some close calls, and the psychological challenge of keeping the team motivated on 18-hour days was intense, but I just couldn’t contemplate quitting. Being bashed by waves as high as telegraph poles for 26 hours across the Gulf of Carpentaria, about 160 miles offshore, was pretty hard yakka. In the Great Australian Bight I had to tie Zorro to the backseat so we wouldn’t lose him while flying fish kept hitting me in the head.",
        "When we came into Hobart 101 days later, having become the first people to circumnavigate Australia in an outboard-powered vessel, I was absolutely rooted. There were beautiful experiences on the trip too of course, especially the Kimberley, and the generosity of Australians stunned me; from a young lad on Kangaroo Island who ran down to see us so he could donate his $1.50 to the guys throwing $100 bills off the gas rigs.",
        "We raised around $300,000 and I ended up being named Tasmanian of the Year and National Geographic’s Traveller of the Year.Time off is dangerous for me because I usually hatch more work plans, but I spend all my downtime relaxing, walking, camping and snorkelling with the family. I’ve walked all the major tracks in Tasmania at some point, as well as the Bruny Island coastline, but my next adventure is likely to be driven by work.",
        "One of the things I want to do more on is improving the bigger picture of plastics in our oceans."

        "* I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL OR A DOCTOR. IF YOU ARE UNSURE ABOUT YOUR CHILD'S HEALTH CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER*That being said I am a mother of five kids one of which has had croup more times than I can even count or remember. He isn't the first of my kids to ever get croup, he is however my child that gets it all of the time. He has even been hospitalized because of it.",
        "So I would say that I know a lot about croup and how to treat and deal with it.My youngest son has had croup just about every other month ever since he was born with the exception of the summer months when it is warmer. He is now six and most doctors will tell you that kids usually grow out of getting croup by the age of about five or six. Not my kid. He is an exception to the rule.",
        "There are some kids that take longer, and we are one of them.After three years of running to the ER for breathing treatments every time he would get croup, I finally had enough. It is so tiring and expensive to go to the ER every other month for breathing treatments. I new the signs of croup and I could tell he was getting it with one cough. I finally sat down with his doctor and asked if there was anything that they could give me to give to him when he first started showing signs of croup.",
        "Because he got it all of the time and my doctor new that I could really tell that he had croup, she gave me a written prescription for a liquid steroid that would open his airway and help him breath better. Can you say HALLELUJAH! The liquid steroids worked wonders! When he started getting croup I would give him the medication and then we could make it through those first two nights. That was three years ago and I have only been to the ER once with him since then.",
        "That ER visit the steroids weren't working because he had strider and he was transported to Primary Children's Medical Center for better treatment. After a couple of day's he was released and all was well.I decided that I wanted to share what tricks I have learned over the years to help your child deal with croup, but first if you are not very familiar with croup you should know the basics.",
        "If you go to the Kids Health website it has a very good explanation of what croup is and how to treat it.Croup is caused by a virus that children get, usually the cold virus or any respiratory virus. A child gets croup because their airway is not large enough when they get this virus and when their airway gets swollen they have a hard time breathing and they get a cough that sounds like a seal barking.",
        "Usually when my kids get croup I have noticed that they are scared because they can't breath well and they usually freak out and cry more, which is totally understandable, it just makes the breathing worse. They can also have a fever and sometime a rash, however my kids never had a rash.5 EASY HOME REMEDIES FOR DEALING WITH CROUP:1. Motrin. Croup is caused when the airway gets inflamed and swells. If you think that your child might have croup then give them some Motrin.",
        "This will help the swelling go down and will also help with any fevers. *DO NOT GIVE MOTRIN TO BABIES UNDER THE AGE OF 6 MONTHS*2. Cool mist humidifier. Cool mist is a great way to help open the airway. If you don't have a humidifier then I would strongly suggest that you get one. They aren't that expensive and it is good to have one if you have kids. If you are going to purchase a humidifier make sure that you get a cool mist one and not a hot mist. You need the cool mist.3. Hot shower.",
        "No you don't put your kid in a hot shower. Turn your shower on to hot and let the mist build up in the bathroom, then sit with your child in the bathroom and let them breath in the mist..OTHER WAYS TO HELP FIGHT OFF CROUP:There are other ways that you can fight off croup if your child comes down with it. These remedies involve some medical intervention. They are however all ways that I have dealt with croup with my children.",
        "In our most resent round of croup two weeks ago, my three youngest kids got it all within two days of each other. Lets just say that I was a walking zombie that week. Thankfully I was able to use these methods as well.1. Breathing treatments. If you have a Nebulizer or know someone who does and they would let you borrow it then you can do at home breathing treatments. You do however need Albuterol which is prescribed by a doctor. I have heard that you can use water and have the mist to breath in.",
        "I have never done this personally.2. Liquid steroids. I think that this might be hard to get unless your child has a history of croup like mine does. I will tell you though that it is a life saver!3. Inhaler. If your child has an inhaler this would be a great time to use it.Croup is no fun. Not for the child or the parent that spends the night caring for and worrying about their sick child.",
        "Hopefully this will help give some guidance to someone who might not be as familiar with croup as I am.Remember that you are the parent and if something doesn't seem right or you are unsure about your child's health there is no shame in asking your doctor or health care provider. They are there to help and they will have your child's best interest in mind."

        "Well, you have to give me some credit for getting quoted. And Andrew's style is to quote his readers' e-mails anonymously, which is just fine. And I will reveal here that the second block quote in this recent piece of his is none other than little old Passionate Moderate Mormon - me. But I think Andrew still doesn't get it.This last summer, my wife, various relatives and friends, and I (six of us total), had a wonderful trip to Britain. One of the many highlights was an afternoon in the British Museum.",
        "(By the way, I recommend a full day or two if you can manage the time - we were a little hurried to see all we could before we got out to the ancestral lands in Wales for the family history purpose of the trip).",
        "Just after the Egyptian exhibit with an actual mummy with very interesting markings on its knees, navel, and breasts (but I'll leave the rest of that to Nibley's intellectual heirs), I came across a surprising display of \"golden plates.\" It was shocking to the max!This is part of the Oxus Treasure from ancient Persia. It dates from the Fifth Century B.C.",
        "which would be a few years after Lehi left Jerusalem and then the city was conquered by the Babylonians, right next to Persia and Persia took it all over a little later. In fact this treasure connects up to none other than Cyrus the Great, the one who in the Bible allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem!",
        "The interesting thing is down at the bottom of the museum's explanation it described \"votive plaques\" which is the same thing as saying \"religious plates.\" They mostly have figures, but also symbols and what looked like some writing to me.Now, I never meant this blog to be an apologists' blog because picking up little pieces of fact here and there in an attempt to prove a point is the same as anti-Mormon or tea-partier proof-texting which I abhor.",
        "But Andrew says \"The story of the golden plates is so obviously a fraud it beggars belief.\" So, I don't get it. Here we have in the Oxus treasure nothing other than religious, gold plates from a time and place not far from where Lehi departed on his journey. So religious gold plates are \"obviously a fraud?\"Maybe it's the Angel Andrew is talking about. Granted, we're right back to matters of belief, not proof of similar angels in the British Museum.",
        "But how can the Angel be so \"obviously a fraud\" when Andrew, a believing Catholic, comes from a rich tradition of angels over the past two thousand years? (Well, just since Christ. I guess Catholicism includes angels from the Old Testament days as well.) Maybe Andrew doesn't believe in Catholic Angels (I don't have much reason to doubt them myself). If so, I guess that's fine. But that's his choice.Maybe it's the whole Book of Mormon history on the plates?",
        "While I can't yet prove it through scientific methods, I am not aware of anything to scientifically or rationally establish the definitive proof that the history is a fraud. I've been to the Yucatan. There were various peoples in the Ancient Americas. They had ancient civilizations. Why couldn't there be a divine history of at least a part of them? In fact, if the plates were real and if the Angel were real and Joseph was a prophet of God, how could the history be a fraud? The Angel lied?",
        "Well, I guess that's the fundamentalist Christian explanation based again on belief, not exactly rationalism. Even the Izapa Stela No. 5, of which I bought a cheap plaster reproduction at an ancient Mayan ruin, may convey some Meso-American mythological figures and not the literal story of Lehi and Nephi. But nobody can tell me that is not a universally recognized \"world tree\" or \"tree of life\" as the central theme of that picture. So, I can't prove or disprove that either.",
        "Book of Mormon history may be improbable but that's not the same thing as rationally impossible.Bottom line, Andrew has done nothing rationally or spiritually to disabuse me of my Faith. And I've had the strongest spiritual witnesses of its truth that Andrew is free to seek, or not, as he chooses.I'll leave Kolob for another day.ADDENDUM 4/27/2011My son points out that he wasn't sure what the context was for that Andrew Sullivan piece.",
        "Here's the original piece from Andrew put up on Easter that we were responding to. And here's the original piece from David Brooks that Andrew was referring, April 26, 2011Andrew Sullivan - Almost Fair and Rational!Very cool pic of the gold plates in England - and the connection to Cyrus. Unfortunately, if even if one of those plates was signed by Nephi, there would still be screams of \"fraud\". (You see, those ancient Egyptians were probably in on the conspiracy from the beginning)thanks, MMM!",
        "We didn't even get to the Ancient America room in the British Museum. Maybe they have something like the liahona in there and haven't noticed."

        "Day 88th December 2016At nine o’clock, we left our apartment after a lovely Turkish breakfast, made by mother, and drove down to Kleopatra beach. The beach is very wide and sweeps all the way on the west side of the peninsular, ending just before you reach the marina.",
        "With its fine golden sands and rows of hotels running behind, the beach is packed in the summer months, but as the winter months roll on , the beach is almost empty…which is great news for the dogs, who can run and jump and bound as much as they want, without disturbing the usually sunburnt and sleeping German tourists.",
        "From the beach, there is a beautiful view looking up at the fortress, which seems very high, and also visible are the tops of the snow capped Taurus mountains.After walking along the beach for an hour and stopping for a drink on the front, we split up, Summer going for a walk and shopping around the town, while Mum, Geoff and I would go into the Damlatas caves.",
        "The dogs were not allowed in, so they wanted in the car with the windows down.The Dalamtas caves are very famous because of there 98% humidity and constant high temperatures, which do cause the Stalagmites and Stalactitesto grow very long and sharp.",
        "The high humidity is meant to help asthma sufferers, and many tourists love to explore the small but incredible cave, however, Geoff did say that the cave in Cheddar Gorge was much more impressive.Afterwards, we went to the Aercheological museum, near the beach. The museum holds many fascinating historical finds, like oil lamps, terracotta jars, hand woven killims, dating from the Seljuk, Ottoman, Greek, Roman and even from the Bronze Age.",
        "Other finds include many old and interesting things such as arrow heads, coins, axe heads, cannon fragments and small but detailed, bronze figurines, which have all mainly been found within the area of the 7km walls of Alanya castle.",
        "The museum does not contain any Atatürk memorabilia, since the main Atatürk history is kept in the Atatürk museum, near Alanya’s Grand Bazaar.We met Summer back at the car and drove back to the apartment, where we had lunch, relaxed, and enjoyed the view.Later that day, we got back in the car and drove to the top of the peninsula, where we went into the great Alanya fortress, which looks over both sides of the town.",
        "The walls, which date back to the 13th century, run all the way from the Red tower, up to the main enclosure that holds a cistern, church and storage rooms. Because of its high location and it being impossible to reach from the sea, air or land, the castle was one of the most well protected castles in Turkey.Most of the interesting parts of Alanya castle are in the little winding lanes leading up to the uppermost parts. Here village life is in full swing with fruit and veg sellers and crafts on display.",

She did rather like the ones painted as Father Christmas!From the viewing points in the castle, there were stunning views that are most impressive, however, there wasn’t too much information about the castle, so, we went back to the apartment to read about it and watched the sun set from the roof."

        "Been a busy couple of days, but in a good way.My buddy Matt is in Maine visiting his family and his fiancee's family. They live in Fairbanks, Alaska, so visits are few and far between. The good news is that I got to go for two runs with him.On Wednesday evening, I met him and Nate for a run from Matt's folks' house in Freeport. Honestly, I have no idea where we went, but it was groovy. From their yard, we connected onto a bunch of trails that offered some nice single track.",
        "It had white and blue blazes just like the AT, kinda neat. Eventually, we hit field, a dirt road, then another road. We turned off this road into a maze of trails that apparently connects to LL Bean intergalactic headquarters. I never really assumed that Matt knew where he was because he probably didn't, but we ended up back at his folks' house in about 54 minutes just as we planned \"no more than an hour.\" Great run and great to catch up with Matt.",
        "And, even though he lives 5 minutes away, this was one of the few runs I've done with Nate all summer. I'd forgotten how cool it is to run with people. (Not that D isn't a people, but we're married, so that's different.)Based on the success of this run and the desire to hang with Matt some more despite his crazy schedule, we made plans to run at Bradbury on Thursday morning.",
        "I wanted to get a longer run in, and no one complained, so I suggested we run the Bradbury Bruiser course.We met early, but not too early, at Bradbury on Thursday morning. It was raining when I woke up but thankfully stopped by the time I headed out the door. It only sprinkled briefly during our run. Matt and Nate were in the crew again, and Kevin also joined us for a short while before he had to get back to work.",
        "I was the only one who had done any/much running at Bradbury, so these guys finally got to see firsthand what I have been raving about.Trails were not as messy as I would have expected. Muddy, yes, but not too bad. I only made one major wrong turn (we ran the Fox East loop backwards), which resulted in us running a good-sized hill twice. No one really complained. I hadn't run the \"O\" Trail since the race last October, and it's significantly more fun when you're not trying to race it.",
        "That being said, it really works you at the end of a run, and we were happy that it eventually spat us out on the other side. Another great run, and great to catch up more with Matt, who claims he's fat and out of shape, but could have easily dusted either Nate or I had he chosen to do so. We arrived back at the parking lot in about 2:06 giving 3 hours of running over the last 2 days. Good stuff.It's turning into a solid week for me, and my legs are feeling it a bit. No pain, just fatigue.",
        "Short run planned tomorrow morning, which will bring my official running miles to 24 for the week. Add in the 20 miles we ran/hiked on Monday, and I'd said that's pretty good marathon base building. Or at least I hope so.1 comment:keep up the training and people might start expecting big things from you!DEA"

        "The next day, I mentioned how overwhelmed I felt to a woman who helped run the placement services and she assured me that this was normal and that you really have to pick and choose only a few things to do each day; if you're planning on looking for a job at the placement services, plan on spending a good chunk of your time there.",
        "Also, remembering to make time to eat is a good idea.- Social events are great for networking - Sunday night I went to the New Members Round Table Social where I not only made new friends who are also recent grads looking for jobs, but I also met the State Librarian of California, the president of PLA, and the president of the Boston Public Library. The new president of ALA was also there, but I didn't get a chance to say hi.",
        "I also made a fool of myself on the dance floor, which probably negated any possibility that any of these people will take me seriously in the future. I have to say though, that you really haven't lived until you've seen hundreds of librarians trying to dance.- The conference paradox - Although as a \"newbie,\" the conference was quite overwhelming, it was empowering as well.",

This was quite the experience. Basically, they let us roam around the main reading room and some of the librarians who work there told us about the history of the room.",
        "We even got to go below the central desk for a peek at the inner workings of the library and the stacks that are off limits to the public. All the attendee librarians were like kids in a candy store.Then I attended the premiere of Hollywood Librarian, a documentary about librarians and how they have been stereotyped through film. This was an excellent film that was at times funny and heartbreaking. You can see the trailer on youtube if you search the title.",

Those were Dr. Holley's words of wisdom he gave me last week when we were talking about the ALA Annual. Well I'm at the conference now, and he was right: I definately feel lost. And in more than one way.",

        "Although every thing said that the service opened at noon today, there was an orientation that started at 11:30 that I did not know about this and people had already signed up to schedule appointments for the resume critiques. Now I have to wait until tomorrow to get that done.",

What do you want to know?Also, many of the orgs are looking for a few good men and women to take over the leadership.

        "I had barely scratched the surface in getting to know Donald’s huge array of gifts and talents, surprising stories and experiences — I am so grateful to have known him and to have shared the Corita connection, but I feel really cheated out of what looked like it was going to be a long and fulfilling friendship. I hope he and Corita are yukking it up right now, as irreverently as possible. I am so sorry for everyone’s loss, I wish we’d had more time.",

        "It is believed that it is caused by an overproduction of melatonin in the body, setting the body into an imbalance. SAD has been debated for years by many as to whether or not it is \"real\". It rose in popularity as a diagnosis for many workers during the 90's.Regardless of what others think, if you are one of the 10% of people in the US diagnosed with SAD, it is very real to you. SAD can make you irritable and make life overall very difficult.",

As with anything medical, I am not a doctor so please consult your medical practitioner before beginning.QiGong is a set of ancient Chinese breathing exercises. Among other benefits, it helps the body come back into balance and regulate the hormones. The appealing thing about QiGong is it can be practiced anywhere and at almost any time.",

Though basic, it is one of the fundamental exercises and even the most advanced students find time to practice this.Step 1: Locate your Dan Tien.According to Chinese practices, your Dan Tien is the powerhouse of the body.",
        "It is located approximately 2 finger-lengths below your bellybutton.Step 2: Place your hand on your Dan Tien.You want to place the middle of your palm (where the energy of the hand flows out of the most) directly over the spot you've identified as your Dan Tien. The idea here is to help you recycle your body's energy and help you keep your focus during the exercise on this part of the body.This particular QiGong exercise is gender dependent.",
        "So if you are female, you want to use your left hand on your Dan Tien. If you are male, you want to use your right hand.Step 3: Complete the circuit.Place your other hand directly over the one on your Dan Tien such that the two palms of your hand are directly over one another.Step 4: Breathe properlyWhen you breathe for this exercise, you want to bring in through your nose and out through your mouth.",
        "With each breath in you want to focus and push down so that it enters your body and goes directly to the Dan Tien. Use the pressure of your hands against your body to direct the flow.You'll know if you're breathing correctly or not by your shoulders. If you find your shoulders are moving up and down, causing your hands to move position, you are breathing into your upper chest, not your Dan Tien.Step 5: Create a rhythm.Take time here to find a nice easy rhythm.",
        "Breathe continuously, never holding your breathe. It should be a nice easy flow of in and out.Slow down your breathing as much as possible. Try to focus on making the length of time you breathe in just as long as the length of time you breathe out.",
        "Make it longer and longer with each breathe to the point you feel completely full on each intake and completely empty on each out.Step 6: Relax.Now that you have the basic mechanics going, close your eyes.Focus your mind on the breathing and feeling each breathe come in and leave your body. Visualize clean air coming in and pushing out any negativity with each breath. Your mind will try to wander to the worries or issues around you. Gently bring those thoughts back to your breathing.",
        "Create a safe space for you to relax and come back to center.Step 7: Finish the exercise.There is no limit or minimal set of time to do this exercise (hence why I say QiGong is a perfect exercise to do just about anywhere). If you only have 1-minutes or 30-minutes, you can do this exercise.When you first start doing this exercise, you may want to spend a bit longer so you can get familiar with your body and get the breathing correct.",
        "But once you've mastered this exercise, you can move quickly through the steps and reach optimal benefit within a breathe or two.As you finish the exercise, reverse the steps performed. So, first open your eyes. Return your breathing to normal. Then remove your top and your lower hand.That's it!After you've finished the exercise, if you've done it correctly, you should feel revived and filled with more energy.",
        "You shouldn't have a strong a craving for certain foods and your body will feel warm and alive.Through regular practice of QiGong exercises, you can help bring your body back to center and combat some of the symptoms of SAD."

Along with learning about the ecological importance of bats, students and adults learn about the fascinating personalities of the individual bats.The program runs approximately 1.5 hours. It sounds like a long time, but there is so much information to cover and bats to be viewed that the time goes very quickly. If we need to shorten it to an hour, we can do that to accommodate your needs.",

        "“The people of Brazil are very excited, as you can see by how well tickets are selling, and we are excited too.“Between now and then, however, we have a series of test events at the stadiums, which are vital in ensuring that fans, team delegations and journalists will all enjoy a wonderful experience this June.”A test event will be held at each of the six FIFA Confederations Cup venues from April, with the LOC playing a part in some operational areas.",

        "There’s plenty of excitement among the people too, as we’ve seen with the ticket sales and the number of Brazilian people signing up for the volunteer programme, with 25,000 people attending group-dynamics sessions.”Meanwhile, in a move designed to safeguard the health of fans, Valcke announced that all the stadiums to be used at the FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA World Cup will be smoke-free.“We’ve done this at other events because we recognise that smoking can cause people discomfort,” he explained.",
        "“Even so, there will still be designated smoking areas at the stadiums.”"

        "She cries when Angelina tries to put anything else on her.\"It is not the first time Shiloh has fallen in love with an item of clothing.Last year, she wanted to wear a ballet tutu at all times, and was seen in it \"for months\".Shiloh's love of clothes doesn't seem to be inherited from her mother.Angelina recently revealed she doesn't spend much time thinking about what she will wear to red carpet events, and is more interested in whether a dress is comfortable than the impact it will have."

        ".”EA interferes with our endocrine system, a complex signaling network that is made up of glands (the thyroid) as well as glandular tissue and cells within organs (testes, ovaries, pancreas, etc). Our endocrine systems use hormones that send signals to our various organs and tissues that work over minutes, hours, weeks, and years. The processes these hormones regulate include metabolism, growth and development, and sexual reproduction.",
        "As hormones travel in the blood to reach each body part, the specific molecular shape of each hormone fits like a key-in-a-lock into receptors on target tissues. Endocrine disrupting chemicals may interfere with, block, or mimic the action of our hormones.",
        "As a result, EA and endocrine disruptors have been linked in hundreds of studies to brain development problems, breast and prostate cancer, birth defects, learning and behavioral problems in children, early onset of puberty, and obesity.Manufacturers are now flaunting their “BPA free” versions of products as though they are safe and free of toxins—but it turns out BPA is possibly just the tip of the iceberg.",
        "Bisphenol S, or BPS, is another chemical that manufacturers are using to replace BPA and it may be just as harmful. In a study this year in Environmental Science and Technology, researchers, the authors found BPS present in 16 types of paper products, including thermal receipts, paper currencies, flyers, magazines, newspapers, food contact papers, airplane luggage tags, printing paper, paper towels, and toilet paper.",
        "The thermal receipt paper samples contained concentrations of BPS that were similar to the concentrations of BPA reported earlier and raised alarm for some scientists. BPS was also detected in 87 percent of currency bill samples. The authors write that several other related compounds are also used to replace BPA: bisphenol B, bisphenol F, and bisphenol AF.",
        "BPA and BPS are found in high concentrations in canned foods, BPF has been found in surface water, sewage sludge, and sediments, and BPB was found in human serum in Italy. “Limited studies have shown that BPS, BPB, and BPF possess acute toxicity, genotoxicity, and estrogenic activity, similar to BPA,” the authors write, adding that, “The environmental biodegradation rates of BPS and BPB were similar to or less than those of BPA.",
        "Although considerable controversy still surrounds the safety of BPA, the potential for human exposure to alternatives to BPA cannot be ignored.” The researchers also note that people may be absorbing BPS in much larger doses—19 times more than the BPA they absorbed when it was more widely used.Bruce Blumberg, professor of developmental and cell biology and pharmaceutical sciences at the University of California, Irvine, wrote in an e-mail, “There are emerging data to show that BPS is an estrogen but relatively less on the other chemicals.",
        "Therefore, it is hard to say with certainty at the moment whether the BPA replacements lack estrogenic activity. BPA free means simply that—that the product is stated to be BPA free.”.”But the FDA continues to insist that BPA is still safe.",
        "In a recent New York Times article, Michael Taylor, deputy commissioner for foods said that the agency, “has been looking hard at BPA for a long time, and based on all the evidence, we continue to support its safe use.”Zuckerman added that part of the problem lies in the heavy influence that industry has on members of Congress and the FDA.",
        "“Whenever the FDA does something to improve patient safeguards, Members of Congress get lobbied by the industry involved and some of those Members pressure [the] FDA to back off,” she wrote in an e-mail. “This has happened for years but the last few years have been even worse than usual.”At Mother Jones, Tom Philpott points out that the heavily monied interests behind BPA are none other than the chemical giants Dow and Bayer who produce the bulk of BPA. Frederick S.",
        "vom Saal, curators’ professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia and BPA researcher told me that BPA represents a $10 billion a year industry. It’s important to note that the recent FDA ban comes at the behest of the American Chemistry Council, an industry trade group that denies any negative health effects from BPA. Why would they have done this?",
        "“[The American Chemistry Council’s] petition to the FDA puts it plainly: ‘All Major Product Manufacturers Have Abandoned the Use of Polycarbonate’ (BPA). In other words: Go ahead and ban it—it’s already been phased out and a ban gives the appearance of strict oversight,” Philpott writes.By creating the ban, the FDA at least acknowledges that babies and children should lessen their exposure to BPA. But what about the rest of the population?",
        "“BPA remains in millions of food and beverage containers that affect the BPA levels of pregnant women, children of all ages, and all adults,” Zuckerman wrote to me in an e-mail. “The impact on the developing fetus and young children, and on breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, are of particular concern to our Center.",
        "One study indicates that BPA may interfere with the effectiveness of chemo for breast cancer patients.”The FDA should concede that if BPA is a risk for babies and children, it is most likely a risk to all of us. And what about the various substitutes that will be used for BPA and the numerous other toxins lurking in the plastics and other containers that package our foods and drinks? “FDA’s decision is a step in the right direction, but it is a baby step,” Zuckerman said.",
        "“They have done the minimum.” Blumberg added that the answers to all of these questions are complex. “We do not know nearly as much as we need to know,” he said. “I think that it is prudent to reduce our consumption of packaged foods of all sorts for a variety of reasons, including reducing exposure to contaminants from the containers.”Photo: Baby with bottle, by Shutterstock“By creating the ban, the FDA at least acknowledges that babies and children should lessen their exposure to BPA.",
        "”Unfortunately, this is simply not true. They withdrew approval at the request of the American Chemistry Council, which represents the manufacturers of BPA. The federal register says: would they do this? To STOP the FDA from acknowledging any harm from BPA.:.”We are all being conned by the American Chemistry Council here. Manufacturers had already abandoned BPA in bottles and sippy cups; now they have Federal protection against imports and defend their position in epoxies by delaying the science."

Next - wrap the entire form in heavy duty aluminum foil. Thengrease the outside of the form lightly with vegetable oil. See Picture #2.3. Prepare the dough. Combine the water, bread flour, whole wheatflour, rye flour and dark rye flour.4. Mix with a dough hook attachment for 4 minutes on low speed.5.",

Usinga rolling pin, pin the dough to a large rectangle - around 15\"X48\".During this rolling process, allow the dough to rest severaltimes. Allow 10 minutes for each rest period, covering with plasticwrap. When complete the dough should be 1/8\" thick.",
        "Keep thedough covered with plastic wrap at all times to prevent drying-out of thedough!7. Using a pizza cutter and a straight edge as a guide, cut longstrips from the rectangle. Each strip should be 1 1/4\" inwidth. See Picture #38. Beginning with the \"tail\" of the cornucopia, startwrapping the long strips around the form. The best way to dothis, is to hold the form in your hand and rotate it slowly asyou thread on the strips. Moisten each strip lightly with waterand make sure they overlap by 3/4\".",
        "Note: make surethe end of the dough strips finish at the bottom of the form.This will insure a seamless final product. SeePicture #49. Continue layering the strips until they are 3\" from themouth of the form. This will allow room for the 3 braided decorativecollar. To make this, simply braid 3 strips of dough, and cutit to length.10. Prepare a sheetpan by covering it with aluminum foil, andgrease it lightly.11. Prepare an egg wash.",
        "In a bowl, whisk together 2 eggs, 1tablespoon of water and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Using a pastrybrush, apply the egg wash to the cornucopia.12. Bake @ 400F for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperatureto 325F, and continue baking for an additional 2 1/2 hours.13. Turn off the oven, open the oven door slightly and allowthe cornucopia to cool-down in the oven for 30 minutes. See Picture #514. Remove the cornucopia from the oven and carefullyremove the metal form. See Picture#615.",
        "Return the cornucopia to the oven and continue baking at250F for 1 1/2 hours. This will allow the dough to dry-out completely!16. When the cornucopia has completely cooled, decorate withassorted Autumn gords, fruits, pine cones and mixed nuts. See Picture #7* To increase shelf life, seal the finishedpiece with a spray acrylic lacquer."

Construye tus Suenos is the business initiative to teach entrepreneurship and business planning to youth.There is a strong case for why one of the target groups for my sector is women.",

But Mercedes-Benz is infusing its dealerships with AR technology to speed up the diagnosis and repair of tricky and complex issues with its Virtual Remote Support, powered by Microsoft's HoloLens 2 and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist.",
        "I visited one of Mercedes' showcases last week to check out the implementation and get some hands-on time with the HoloLens 2.For customers that bring in a hard-to-solve problem, it was common for Mercedes-Benz to call in a flying doctor, an expert from HQ that would fly in and get hands-on with an issue. That could take days to arrange, not to mention the costs and environmental impacts associated with flying in these technical specialists from all over the country.",
        "All the while, the customer is left without their luxury automobile.While many shoppers go with a Mercedes for the styling and performance, it's the service experience that impacts their future purchases. Long waits could see someone changing brands in the future.Mercedes is arming all 383 dealerships across the U.S.",
        "with this Virtual Remote Assistant, hoping to improve the efficiency of their service bays and keep customers happy.It all starts with the HoloLens 2, an augmented reality headset with four visible light cameras for head tracking, two infrared cameras for eye tracking, a depth sensor, a five-channel microphone array, and built-in speakers.The local technician puts on the HoloLens and can then pull up wiring diagrams, schematics, and other details on the headset, so they can refer to them while they're working on the customer's vehicle.If the problem needs assistance from one of the experts, they can call them and even provide them a visual feed from his headset.",
        "The experts see what the technician does, and their face is broadcast in a small portion of the screen. It’s like a futuristic Zoom or Teams meeting call happening in your eyeglasses. Ever helpful, those experts can add arrows, circles, and other notes to help point out important issues.Using the headset requires little orientation. All you do is put it on and do a short calibration. It follows your eyes and can recognize your hands.",
        "You look down and tap your wrist to bring up a menu that allows you to start your work or teleconference. It’s projected onto the glass of the headset but looks like it’s floating in front of you. You can reach out and interact and manipulate the windows with a variety of gestures.",
        "It all feels similar to the movie Minority Report and was pretty intuitive to use.When I was finished goofing around with the headset, Mercedes-Benz representatives explained that the technology has the potential to completely change the service industry.",
        "A career that is typically associated with trades work, can now become more digital and high-tech, attracting a whole new demographic of students and employees.Mercedes boasts that their cars today have more lines of software code than the Space Shuttle, an F-35 fighter jet, and a pacemaker combined. This much functionality means more complexity. So to chase down and resolve any complex issues, the automaker has turned to the HoloLens.",
        "Referencing a wiring diagram or schematic that’s projected in 3D space onto the car you’re working on, will help cut down on wasted time.Furthermore, while automakers boast that electric vehicles will feature fewer moving parts and require less maintenance, these advanced vehicles may still have issues, likely with wiring and digital components.",
        "Technicians using HoloLens can chase down these issues quicker than those having to go back and forth between the computer and the car.Ready for the next level of displays?

With the new S-Class, that information is overlaid right on the windshield with an augmented reality windshield. The automaker sees more opportunities for HoloLens 2.",
        "It can be used for sales training or even with customers on the showroom floor, customizing their car before their eyes.Since the introduction of augmented reality, it seemed destined for this kind of application -- infusing hands-on work and know-how with data to make complex tasks easier. Now that Mercedes is putting it into action, we're looking forward to see just how effective it can be."

        "27, 2013.Culligan said the museum, which has had in years past several rail-themed exhibits, was due for a great show such as this photographic survey of train history that is packed with dramatic places and people.This survey of images runs from the 1850s up through 2006 of everything from scenery and train wrecks to workers and famous trains that have made a mark on history.Culligan said each photographer's style and subject draw you in.Photographers such as Aaron Siskind and Lewis W.",
        "Hine documented workers back in the 1930s and 1940s.Siskind captured the life of the \"Pullman Porters,\" while Hine's work, \"Railroad Workers and Rail Photos,\" from 1925, was a step behind the sooted scenes of the train into the work of the steam boiler operators, the trackwalkers, the wheel grinders, the car waiters and the switch operators.Many of the early train photos show trains taking people where they could have never gone before without great difficulty from 1865 snow galleries near Crested Peak in Nevada and the canyons of Grand River in Utah to Henri-Cartier-Bresson's work, \"Caravan on Rails\" from 1961, a Time Life picture from a Mongolian desert showing how the rail had replaced the camel caravan of Marco Polo's days.\"They wanted to show how much photography and trains had changed life,\" Culligan said of why the exhibit was organized by the Eastman House.",

        "Trains made traveling so much easier, and photography allowed people to be able to capture real moments of life.\"The exhibit shows how the two were married together in such promotional pieces as the Carleton Watkins' stereograph series of prints showing the grandeur of Pullman's Palace cars as well as a 1926 Kodak ad saying \"Take a Brownie With You,\" showing a woman on a train with her camera on her lap.The exhibit shows also how photographers have been there throughout rail history to capture the good, the bad and the ugly.A C.R.",

        "Cornelius Ryan, a World War II war correspondent and best-selling author, solicited first-hand accounts of civilians and military personnel from the United States, Great Britain, France and Germany, for use in his best-selling books, like \"The Longest Day.\" In 1981, Ryan's collection of primary source materials, a sought-after resource worldwide, was donated to Ohio University Libraries.Now, through this gift from Iron Mountain's Living Legacy Initiative - the company's commitment to preserve and make accessible cultural and historical information – over 1,100 items that make up 4,900 pages of Ryan's collection related to D-Day will be digitized, including many of those first-hand eyewitness accounts like this one from Private First Class Richard Cator of the 101st Airborne Division:\"We had stopped and were digging in.",
        "A shell from an artillery barrage landed in a foxhole approximately 50 feet from me and blew a man out of the hole into some bushes. I was surprised, and later amused, when he came running around the bushes, hopping mad at the Germans for ruining his foxhole. He didn't have a scratch on him.",
        "It wasn't until later that he realized how close he had come to being blown to bits.\"Through the digitization services from Iron Mountain, Cornelius Ryan's unique collection of extensive interviews (like Cator's) is now available , as along with letters, diaries, and observations, sharing various accounts of D-Day as told through the eyes of soldiers, civilians, and political figures.",

        "Ryan is best-known for three books on specific battles from the war; \"A Bridge Too Far,\" \"The Last Battle,\" and \"The Longest Day,\" which provide some of the most accurate accounts of that period of history, all of which were later made into movies.\"This is a tremendous gift from Iron Mountain that not only supports the Ohio University Libraries, but also honors American history, journalism, and the sacrifices of the men and women who fought in World War II,\" said Nico Karaogosian, vice president of University Advancement and president and CEO of The Ohio University Foundation.",

        "Yum! Brands Inc.",
        "plans to double Taco Bell’s domestic annual sales to $14 billion by 2021, according to two securities analysts who attended investor meetings with the company Tuesday.Louisville, Ky.-based Yum, which also operates and franchises KFC and Pizza Hut, told attendees that system growth would include an increase in average unit volumes from $1.3 million in fiscal 2012 to about $1.8 million by the end of the decade, as well as growing its unit count from 5,700 to 8,000 locations.RELATED• Yum: 'No truth to rumors' in mutton supply controversy• Yum 1Q profit drops 27%• More quick-service news at NRN.comAccording to research notes from Andy Barish of Jefferies Group and David Tarantino of Robert W.",
        "Baird, Yum officials were bullish on Taco Bell’s chances of doubling its $7 billion in sales in 2012, based on the brand’s daypart expansions, menu line extensions, unit-growth opportunities and marketing.Driving AUVs via the menuTaco Bell plans to get the majority of the $7 billion increase in incremental sales by 2021 by growing average unit volumes with more menu items and more dayparts, the analysts wrote.Tarantino noted that Taco Bell management was optimistic about the chain’s ability to drive same-store sales in the afternoon snack daypart, where it holds a 1.2-percent market share, compared with its 3-percent share of quick-service sales for lunch and dinner.",
        "He added that the “Happier Hour” initiative in which Taco Bell promoted Loaded Grillers contributed greatly to the chain’s 6-percent increase in first-quarter same-store sales.He also wrote that Taco Bell has successfully tested breakfast, mostly in the West, and intends to roll out the morning meal systemwide by 2014.",
        "Its breakfast lineup includes a crunchy breakfast wrap, bite-size Cinnabon-branded cinnamon rolls, oatmeal, yogurt parfaits and coffee.Barish noted that line extensions in the works for Taco Bell include a Flamas-flavored Doritos Locos Taco, shredded chicken on the main menu and new Mountain Dew frozen beverage flavors.",
        "The Cantina Bell menu will get steak quesadillas and fajitas this year, Barish wrote, “and though sales mix is currently around 4 percent of sales — skewing toward females, over-35 [customers] and higher incomes — the platform continues to drive improvements in customer perceptions about Taco Bell’s quality and freshness.”He added, “We see a long runway for Taco Bell’s innovative platforms and like the focus on store economics and brand engagement.”New buildings for building salesThe more than 2,000 new locations Taco Bell projects it could open would account for the remaining $3 billion in incremental sales, based on 2012’s average unit volumes, Barish noted.",
        "That would dictate a pace of opening between 100 and 130 restaurants this year, double that range in 2014 and 2015, and then about 200 openings per year.“Yum sees a big opportunity in rural areas and thinks about half of the new units can be in Small Town, USA,” Barish wrote, “with 700 to 800 stores in the concept’s current sweet spot, suburban markets.",
        "Taco Bell is also moving slowly into urban markets and has developed flexible models, including an in-line prototype, to execute on the 200-to-300-unit opportunity.”The chain also disclosed several details of its revised franchise agreements, Barish added, including an increase in the franchise term to 25 years, with a required remodel halfway through.",
        "The new arrangement for required franchisee contributions to the national marketing fund does away with local-marketing spending in favor of all-national advertising.Más “Live Más”Barish wrote that the shift toward more national marketing would be significant for Taco Bell, resulting in an increase between 35 percent and 40 percent to its gross ratings points, a measurement marketers use to quantify the size of an audience for a given advertising campaign.“The new national-only marketing program … allows Taco Bell to support breakfast without putting lunch or dinner occasions at risk,” he wrote, also noting that breakfast accounted for 5 percent of sales mix with very little marketing support in the 800 locations in the West where it was tested.“While Taco Bell will continue to develop new flavors and improve ingredients in the kitchen, we were most impressed by the ways in which the company interacts with guests to build brand loyalty,” Barish wrote.",
        "“Management has used the increased national media to cultivate an almost lifestyle brand that Millennials can connect with and then utilizes social and digital tools to amplify this relationship.”Both he and Tarantino of Robert W.",
        "Baird wrote that they were impressed with the continued strength of Taco Bell’s “Live Más” tagline and branding, as well as the heavy emphasis and resources put toward strengthening that positioning via social media.“Taco Bell has developed an innovative ‘Fishbowl’ that serves as a dedicated center in which marketing employees monitor news flow and consumer chatter about the brand, while generating active online dialogue with customers that helps to amplify the brand message,” Tarantino wrote.",
        "“As an example of the power of this approach, the Fishbowl execution helped Taco Bell realize over 2 billion [social-media] impressions for Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos before the launch of the product.”Irvine, Calif.-based Taco Bell produces as much as 20 percent of Yum’s total annual profit, Tarantino noted.Yum operates or franchises more than 39,000 restaurants in more than 130 countries.Contact Mark Brandau at mark.brandau@penton.com.Follow him on Twitter: @Mark_from_NRN"

        "Estate Planning for Equine Owners>>IMAGE ‘Somebody exclusion amounts are gradually increasing from $2 million in 2007 to $3.5 million in 2009. In 2010 there is no estate tax, and in 2011 the applicable exclusion amount remains uncertain. Estates that exceed the exclusion amount may be subject to federal tax ranging from 36%-55% (1). This can leave a large hole in what remains of the estate for heirs.",
        "You may be thinking, “My estate couldn’t possibly be over the exclusion amount, $2 million is a lot of money so I shouldn’t worry about estate tax.\" Remember the uncertainty surrounding the exclusion amount in 2011, the lower that amount remains, the more revenue the government gains in taxes. If the amount settles back to a $1 million exclusion,.Probate issuesThe ultimate goal of estate planning is to efficiently transfer assets and property from one generation to another.",
        "There are a few different ways this can be accomplished: 1) by passing through the probate process, 2) by right of a contract with named beneficiaries, or 3) by rights of survivorship whereby when one owner dies, everything transfers automatically to the other owner.The probate process is one of the most important concepts to understand in estate planning.",
        "When an individual dies and leaves a will, his or her estate goes through probate, by which a state court supervises, administers and distributes the property. The probate estate includes all of the property that is in your name at the time of your death.",
        "Providing that there is no successful challenge in probate proceedings, the court will allow a final distribution of your estate after all debts and taxes are satisfied.In the alternative, property owned by right of contract and by right of survivorship will pass outside the probate process. These assets avoid the delay and public record of the judicial system.",
        "Some examples of non-probate property includes: 1) property held in a trust where the property passes to others on death according to the terms of the document, 2) property owned in joint tenancy at death which passes to the surviving joint tenant automatically on death, 3) life insurance on your life that names a beneficiary other than your estate, and 4) qualified plans, such as 401(k)s and IRAs that name a beneficiary other than your estate.Revocable living trustsOne of the more popular probate-avoiding estate planning tools is the revocable living trust.",
        "A revocable living trust creates a legal entity that owns your assets. You can dictate the provisions of the trust document which will control the disposition of the assets inside the trust during your disability or your death. For example, if you have certain wishes for a pet or a horse you can outline them within these trust provisions. The person who must follow the directions outlined in the trust is the trustee, they hold fiduciary duty.",
        "Typically, the initial trustee of a revocable living trust is you. Upon your death or disability, a successor trustee, whom you named in the trust document, takes over to distribute your property according to your wishes.Equine assets in the estatePlease remember that anyone with assets, family, children or horses should evaluate an estate plan. If you have children, a will is necessary to ensure that if you die, you (and not a judge) have chosen a guardian for them.",
        "For those of us with horses, remember that with proper care and a little luck, horses can live for 25 to 30 years, sometimes even outliving their owners. When that happens, the surviving horses become tangible personal property in the estates of their deceased owners. Though subject to laws prohibiting cruelty to animals, the law treats surviving horses and other companion animals just like any other assets in the estate.",
        "Unless specific instructions are provided in an estate plan, the executor or administrator of the estate has the discretion to keep the equine asset in the estate, sell it at auction or by private treaty or otherwise humanely dispose of it, such as by euthanasia.Pet trustsAnother trust which is becoming increasingly popular with pet owners is a pet trust.",
        "Several states, including Oregon, permit legally enforceable pet trusts so that individuals can transfer funds to an enforceable trust to provide for the care of their pet. In a pet trust, you name a trustee who will carry out your wishes for the animal, and provide detailed instructions for the distribution of trust funds for the animal’s care. In addition, you name a caretaker who will care for the pet if you cannot do so.",
        "The document should include the identity of the pet, the amount of compensation for the pet’s caretaker, and should specify additional details and instructions about the care of the animal, its habits and needs, end-of-life decisions, and other guidelines and instructions that would be important to the care and support of your companion animals.Estate planning for pets and other companion animals like horses is a new niche, so you will want to seek out an attorney who is well-versed in this area of the law.",
        "When establishing any trust, however, you will need to hire an attorney to draft the trust, preferably a lawyer with experience in estate planning.",
        "Eden Rose Brown, an estate planning attorney out of Salem, OR has drafted many pet trusts over the years and has found that, “We’ve had a number of clients who feel that sometimes their pets are more important than their children.” She emphasizes that in the right situation, a pet trust is a responsible, loving thing to do for your pets and is an important part of a comprehensive estate plan.It is important to understand that a trust is just an empty bucket until the appropriate assets are re-titled into the name of the trust.",
        "As we discussed above, the way the asset is titled dictates whether the asset will avoid probate. Many times clients spend a great deal of money to have an attorney draft a trust in order to avoid probate but never change the ownership of their assets. The consequences of this inaction may force some of these “unfunded” assets to go through probate.",
        "Therefore, it is very important that if you do set up a trust, be sure to use an attorney who knows how to assist you in the proper transfer of your assets into the name of the trust.Estate planning is importantThough proper estate planning can sometimes be a complex process, having the right professional team can lift much of that burden. And while getting started can be daunting, remember the values that guide you and your family, and let those guide the process.",
        "Taking the time to think about these issues will preserve your life’s work for your family, your horses and your community.!Published: May 13, 2010; Updated:1) *This information is a general discussion of the relevant tax laws.

        "Teddy bears have been having picnics for decades. It’s true. In fact, back in 1932, Jimmy Kennedy wrote the lyrics to the popular song we know today as Teddy Bear’s Picnic. It’s written to an amazing melody if you listen closely. There’s a lot of history to cute stuffed animals having picnics! There’s also hundreds of versions of the song, we especially like this one by Bing Crosby.",
        "There’s even a kid friendly cartoon version but if you share with kids, be sure to use SafeShare.tv!With Teddy Bear Picnic Day officially being, July 10th we decided to have some fun and create a special MyPlate themed Teddy Bear Picnic Activity Guide.

Laminate them and place them around the room.Playing the tune of Teddy Bear Picnic have the children dance and move around the room. When you pause the music they must find a colored MyPlate bear shaped paw to freeze on. You can even quiz them and ask them to shout out what color MyPlate food group they’re standing on!",

        "Depending on the age, the adult may do this for them.Have the children decorate their peanut butter bread with strawberries for the ears, bananas for the eyes and blueberries for the nose and mouth. If they get creative with this, that is okay.",
        "It’s the process, not the final product that matters!Talk with them about what MyPlate food groups their snack foods belong in.Serve with milk and don’t forget to ask them what MyPlate food group milk belongs in!Tip: This is a great time to check their knowledge on the food groups and what they’ve learned or still need to learn.Activity 5: Pack a MyPlate PicnicObjective: For children to make healthy food choices and pack a healthy MyPlate picnic.Using our free downloadable picnic basket coloring page, have the children tear or cut out photos of food from catalogs or magazines.",

        "CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA—Street preacher Sam Bethea watched an execution last night. He didn't know if the man was dead, but it looked that way.\"Brains,\" Bethea said. \"Blood everywhere. They blew off the top of his head. And that's when I started saying my prayers.\"Late this afternoon, a source told the local NBC affiliate that the victim had died.Today, Bethea and others outside of the Omni Hotel milled about and sat on benches near where the shooting took place Wednesday night.",
        "They dismissed rumors that police fired the bullet that landed in the still-unnamed man's head.\"There was a lot of pushing and shoving,\" said Jerome, a homeless Army veteran who was feet away from the man who got shot. He didn't want to give his last name. \"Then someone raised up with a gun.",
        "Pow!\"The shooting came during a particularly chaotic stretch last night when Jerome says police were simply overwhelmed by a large and raucous crowd of people protesting the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott—killed Friday holding a book or a gun, depending on which version of the story you believe.",
        "After over-running police, arguments and fights broke out among members of the crowd—Jerome attributed the eruption of violence to rival gang members being in close quarters—and someone pulled a gun. Then came the blood.\"Blew off the top of his head,\" Bethea said.A man stepped in to help, Jerome and Bethea explained, but was pushed and punched away as the blood began pooling on the brick sidewalk.",
        "Jerome said the Good Samaritan was a news reporter who tried to perform CPR; Bethea thought he was a security guard. Whoever he was, he couldn't reach the victim. For whatever reason, some in the crowd around the man wanted him to bleed out. Then the police arrived.Officers and citizens carried the man away to an armored police truck. He made it to the hospital alive.",
        "He died less than 24 hours later.Jerome will head to a men's shelter downtown tonight, just in case things get as crazy as they were last night. Bethea will maintain his ministry on the corner outside the Omni Hotel, and he'll continue preaching to young men, who he says oftentimes don't want to hear it.As he handed out lanyards reading \"I love Jesus\" on Thursday afternoon, one such man approached. \"He was kicking in windows last night. I saw him on the news,\" Bethea alleged.",
        "\"Let's see what he says.\"\"I had to go savage,\" the man told Bethea, laughing.\"Don't do savage,\" Bethea responded. \"Do love.\""

        "Eileen Toreja. Starting in July 2012 with 78 cattle from the National Dairy Authority, the farm now has 126 cattle. The visiting team included Asia/South Pacific Program Officer Dilip Bhandari, Heifer Philippines Senior Program Manager for the Field Lyndell Tagle, and Regional Program Manager for Southern Philippines Jun Ayensa.",
        "They discussed the availability of animal stocks in the Philippines over the next 10 years with the farm owners.Next, the team visited the Batangas Dairy Cooperative (BADACO), a large-scale dairy multiplier farm focusing on cattle. The team visited both the dairy farm and the processing plant, where 25 $25,000 state-of-the-art automated dairy machines were recently set up.",
        "Edwin Sanchez, general manager of BADACO, talked with the visitors about the cooperatives plans for further expansion.The last stop was St. Elmos Farm, a dairy goat farm in Nasugbo, Batangas. Owner Elmer Rivera shared with the team the daily farm operation process. The 4.9-acre farm has an average production of about 265 pounds of goat milk per day.",
        "He said that dairy as an enterprise is very promising, since there are very few players in the market and the demand for milk is very high and has grown continuously over the years.At the end of the visits, Jun Ayensa said, The study visit has shared new insights for us. Through the lessons learned we can further improve our project design and implementation.",
        "It really shortened the learning curve, having seen it firsthand how the entire dairy process works.Learn how you can support families around the world."

        "With Google to answer all of your questions and new real estate listing websites, it can seem like a great money saving idea to skip the real estate agent and tackle the market on your own. While this can be done, it makes the process of buying or selling a house infinitely more stressful, time consuming and difficult.",
        "There are many reasons to hire a real estate agent and here are 10 really obvious ones that you should consider before you decide to take on the market alone.[- A good agent will help you buy or sell a home quickly. When you are on your own to buy or sell your home, it will take quite a bit of time to do the how-to research, scouring online listings and neighborhoods, deciding on price, etc. With the help of a real estate agent you can get it all done 37% faster according to a recent study.",
        "Agents have the contacts and skills to attract buyers when you’re selling and to locate the hottest buys when you’re in the market.- Get more money for your listing. The right agent and company can impact your financial outcome by as much as 20%. One long term analysis of sale-by-sale performance in the Orange County market showed that sellers who list with First Team can expect their property to sell for an average of 11.3% more than if they work with another broker.",
        "That means more money in your pocket when you consider that most agents only take a commission of around 3%. We sell homes for more because we are in touch with more buyers through our Buyer PipelineSM system. Also, if you sell your home without an agent, buyers will expect to pay less. They know you won’t be paying an agent commission and they will price their offer accordingly.",
        "And if you’re a buyer, you don’t pay for your agent at all; their commission comes out of the home sale – not your pocket!- Help in the negotiation process. Keeping your cool through the endless negotiations between buyers and sellers can be difficult. That’s why at First Team, we train all of our agents to utilize the latest and most successful negotiating practices.",
        "That means you get every possible advantage in your home sale which is particularly important when it comes to presenting your offer as a buyer. While the industry standard is simply faxing over offers, our agents make every effort to present yours face-to-face, increasing the odds that yours gets accepted.- Agents who work for top companies have the extra resources and tools it takes to succeed. When you buy or sell a home yourself, you are tackling the process alone.",
        "Real estate companies however have tons of resources available to help agents buy and sell faster and more efficiently. For example, First Team has tons of amazing resources and tools available to our agents, and in turn their clients, like our Sneak PreviewSM and Buyer PipelineSM programs. Our Sneak PreviewSM program allows you to view homes listed by First Team agents before they hit the MLS so you have first pick at brand new properties.",
        "And the Buyer PipelineSMhelps sellers find a buyer sooner by archiving all buyer clients with First Team agents, bringing buyers and selling together more effectively and efficiently than ever. With these tools and our company marketing budget of over $4 million dollars, you know that you’re in good hands with a First Team real estate agent.- Save you hassle with difficult buyers and sellers. If you’re selling and showing you house, an agent can do that for.",
        "They will deal with difficult and pesky buyers, ward of lookie loos and help hook serious buyers. If you’re buying, an agent will play hard ball for you when you’re trying to get an offer in, help you negotiate a new home purchase with overbearing builders and act as a buffer between you and the seller if need be.- They've got the inside scoop on the market. While most homes for sale can be found and viewed online, sometimes sellers don’t want their home publicized.",
        "Only agents will have the scoop on these listings and get you in for a tour. Also, agents who know a neighborhood well will know more details of a home than what is on the listing. A real live agent is a much better searcher than the web when it comes to specifics like good home office spaces or crown molding in a home.- They’ve got connections in the industry. When you buy or sell a home you’re going to be dealing with inspectors, lawyers, movers, mortgage lenders and more.",
        "First Team is a part of a family of over 60 company locations, 30 First Team locations and 1,600 agents. Our agents can recommend professionals with authority because they have connections to the top experts in the industry. It can be daunting to have to research, interview and choose all of these companies and pros on your own.",
        "If you have an agent, you can rely on their expertise and connections with your community and the real estate industry to help you through the home buying and selling process.- Getting the price right. Properly estimating home value is vital to home buying and selling in order for you to get the most bang for your buck whether you’re a buyer or seller. That’s why at First Team we use a Comparable Market Analysis (CMA) report to determine what your house is worth.",
        "Our CMA report pulls in comparable homes in your neighborhood to give a home value range for your property that is a true representation of the current market. If you’re thinking of selling your home, reach out to a First Team agent to do a CMA for you so you know exactly what your home is worth and what it will sell for.- Help with the work load.",
        "You already have a job and chances are you don’t have time for the exhaustive paperwork, research, negotiations and appointment setting that goes along with buying and selling a home. There’s a reason people have careers as real estate agents – it’s a full time gig! Don’t drive yourself crazy with tricky contracts, home repair requests, offers and endless counter offers.",
        "You will have to learn a bit about these things during the home buying and selling process but it all becomes manageable when you have an agent to lead you through it all.- Help in the closing process. Closing a home purchase now takes on average 44 days. That’s a long and lengthy process with lots to keep on top of. When you have the help of a real estate agent, the closing process will go by quicker and much more smoothly.",
        "Again, negotiating skills are imperative in this stage and with an agent you can feel confident that everything is getting done efficiently and effectively with your interests in mind.Contact me at bob.young@cbgreatlakes.com"

When the Germans start producing hybrid luxury sedans, however tentatively, it signals an industry shift.Still, before you invite the president of Greenpeace to a Four Seasons lunch, let’s qualify those Environmental Protection Agency numbers.",
        "The Mercedes S400 gets 19 miles per gallon on Manhattan’s Park Avenue and 26 on the Long Island Expressway. The BMW’s results aren’t official, but I saw numbers of around 16 while idling on Worth Street and 24 when whipping to Chappaqua on the Saw Mill Parkway. The Lexus gets 20 and 22.Prius numbers? Hardly. That’s because none of the three can move under electric power alone. The gas engine is shut off when stopped and the electric motor temporarily provides power.",
        "It can also provide extra torque when moving. Toyota’s Prius, which can briefly run on electric power alone, gets 51 mpg in town.Dismal V-12Still, the fuel consumption is about 15 percent to 20 percent better than the regular V-8 models. Both the 7 and S-Class also are available with 12-cylinder engines, which get a dismal 11 to 13 mpg around town.",
        "(The V-12s, which have massive premiums, are the equivalent of a pricey wristwatch with fancy complicated mechanics -- unnecessary, but see how it moves!)You can buy the S400 today, leaving BMW in the dust as showrooms must wait until this spring for the ActiveHybrid 7.Moneymen talk figures, so to price: The BMW will go for $103,125, with a more desirable long-wheelbase version starting at $107,000.",
        "That’s a $20,000-plus premium over the gas-only version, or the salary of a worker in the mailroom.Mercedes has positioned the S400 at less than $90,000, making it the economy player in the S-Class lineup -- $3,600 less than the S550. That’s a bottle of 1982 Chateau Petrus.Audi PlanOther than the hybrid badging, both sedans look identical to their all-gas counterparts. Which brand you choose partly depends on which look appeals -- the BMW’s modern slickness versus the strong solidity of the Mercedes.",
        "(Audi plans to show a full hybrid based on the new A8 at the Geneva Motor Show.)In terms of comfort, the 7 Series’ front seats are my favorite of any modern car, comfortable for bodies big and small. The back seat is huge, and the overall padding throughout the cabin is lovely to feel. Every button and knob is firm and pleasant to the touch -- the best build quality of any Bimmer.Not that the Mercedes is a slouch.",
        "I hauled three passengers to Delaware from New York and they later complained that their hotel bed wasn’t nearly the equal of the S400’s cabin. It’s got beautiful burl walnut and leather all around.The big difference in price comes from the S400’s power deficit over the 7. The Mercedes is a comparatively gentle machine with a combined 295 horses and 284 pound-feet of torque out of its V-6 and electric motor.",
        "You can get to 60 mph in about 7.2 seconds.German RoadsI experienced no real lack of zing, however. The S-Class is not supposed to make burnouts at traffic lights anyhow. It’s bred for the wide-open roads of Germany, and on that Delaware drive I made excellent time without even approaching the electronically controlled top speed of 130 mph.The ActiveHybrid 7 Series is a power player, with a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 married to an electric motor with a combined 455 horsepower and 515 pound-feet of torque.",
        "It’ll get to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds. Yowza.Throttle and suspension settings include comfort, normal, sport and sport sharp, and they change the temperament faster than a CEO on a golf trip being called to appear before Congress.",
        "Both cars are more manageable in traffic and windy roads than oversize SUVs.And in these days of foregone bonuses and carbon footprints, CEOs may like to show that it’s not just the color of their money that’s green.The 2010 Mercedes S400 Hybrid andBMW ActiveHybrid 7 at a GlanceEngines: 3.5-liter V-6 and electric motor with 295 horsepower; 4.4-liter V-8 and electric motor with 455 hp.Transmissions: 7-speed automatic; 8-speed automatic.Speed: 0 to 60 mph in 7.2 seconds; 4.7.Gas mileage per gallon: 19 city, 26 highway; 16, 24 (estimated).Price as tested: $105,230; $107,300 (estimated).Best feature: Decent gas mileage in a classic S-Class package; rip-roaring performance with all the comfort.Worst features: Both are mild hybrids, which don’t get the same gas improvements as full hybrids.Target buyer: The executive who wants to be seen to be green.."

        "I cringe when I see a task which could be automated done manually, but complex tasks are not trivially considered possible to be automated -- to even fathom such possibilities on complex tasks at times you have to divide the work into sub tasks and eventually see if its possible to automate a series of them and which ones cannot be automated.",
        "I've had a hunch about about the prospects of fully automating Linux kernel backporting for a while now, over the years a set of advances and practices on the backports project has increased my confidence of these prospects, one of them was Increasing Automation in the Backporting of Linux Drivers Using Coccinelle SmPL [paper].",
        "If a long paper is too much to digest, check out the Automatically backporting the Linux kernel video presentation (and if you want to learn about Coccinelle SmPL check out Julia Lawall's Coccinelle tutorial at the 2014 SUSE Labs Con) from my presentation at the 2014 SUSE Labs Conference or previous blog post about that.",
        "Towards the end of my presentation I hint at some further prospects in automation with the possibility of doing self programming of the shared backports layer targetting collateral evolutions, but I'll now review one features some folks have pestered me for a bit to incorporate: direct kernel integration with backports and which I recently completed during the 2014 SUSE Hackweek.We now have the framework to optimize backporting collateral evolutions with the use of patches, Coccinelle SmPL grammar patches, and a shared layer.",
        "The development flow we follow helps track linux-next daily, and this reduces the amount of work when we're close to a release made by Torvalds or Greg KH. Although we make both daily linux-next based releases and also stable releases what we provide is a tarball and users and system integrators have no way of making what we provide non-modular. This is a problem for some ecosystems such as Android and ChromeOS which do not like to ship modules.",
        "You can technically take such releases, modify them somehow, and then allow integration to be able to build these drivers as built-in and although I know some folks have used this strategy before (ChromeOS was one, OpenWrt has been doing this for years) its not easy to upkeep, and update, and when a new release is made you have to re-do all the work. As of backports-20141114 we now have backports kernel integration support merged.",
        "What this means is that folks that need to stick to older kernels as base can use the backports project to do the integration of drivers from future kernels onto their kernel, with full kconfig support. You get what you expect, a new sub menu entry under 'make menuconfig' which lets you enter a submenu that lets you enable either as module / built-in device drivers / subsystems from future kernels to replace your older kernel's drivers / subsystems.",
        "The work to integrate a backports release is therefore now automated.As you'd expect device drivers from future kernels can only be selected if the respective older driver is disabled. You can opt to compile backported drivers as modular or built-in. The ability to compile in device drivers as built-in also now enables the possibility to add support into backports features and components from the kernel which we were previously not able to backport.",
        "Integration support enables a one shot full integration support from a future release to an older release, the way to upgrade then would require simply rebasing your kernel as you bump your base kernel and doing another kernel integration when needed. If you are not rebasing your kernel in order to only upgrade to a new future set of backported drivers you can just drop the old backports/ directory and attempt a new integration with the newer release.",
        "This means you should clearly document non-upstream cherry picks on top of a backport integration, cherry pick them out and later merge them back in.",
        "This purposely favours upstream development work flow, if your cherry picks are on route upstream when you bump to a new backport you likely will drop most of the cherry picks you carry, in fact if you have policies in place to ensure they are upstream by a future release integration you'd be always striving towards 0 delta, and of course, 0 delta would imply fully automated backport work then.",
        "I hope this alone might encourage some folks to consider their own development work flows a bit, in particular those with over 6 million lines of code delta, and umm, with it taking them over 6 months to complete a rebase ;) ... On a modern laptop running the integration takes about 1-2 minutes to complete. More details are available the on the backports wiki section on backports kernel integration support.",
        "If you have any questions poke on IRC #kernel-backports on freenode or join the backports mailing list."

        "I lost count of how many boxes, but enough that I wasn’t without a pot for the 5 weeks prior to the Jenson Button Trust Triathlon and for a week or two after. That’s 7 weeks of free yoghurt. You can imagine the pain of going cold turkey when I ran out…luckily I’ve found a local stockist to feed my new addiction (Tesco, Tewkesbury Road, Cheltenham).Firstly, here’s what Chobani say about their yoghurt:“We take fresh milk and add a special recipe of yoghurt cultures, blended just for us.",
        "We then authentically strain our yoghurt and add real fruit. The result is thick, creamy yoghurt that is packed with protein – an indulgent yet healthy treat”“Contains five live active cultures including s.thermaphilus, bulgaricus, l.acidophilus, bifidus and l.casei.”“0% fat and at least 13g of protein in every pot”I don’t know what most of that means, but I do know that they taste amazing!",
        "The thick and creamy claim is totally founded, in fact when I opened my first one it was so thick I thought it was going to be chewy! But as soon as the spoon sunk in to it through to the real fruit in the bottom I knew I was in for a treat.This prompted a debate, in fact I thought about starting an online poll but I had to go for a training swim instead. So I’ll just tell you how I enjoyed Chobani yoghurts…I’m a stirrer.",
        "That’s right, I rip the lid off, get in there with the spoon and give it a stir until the whole pot is a fruity yoghurt concoction. I know some of you are fruit at the bottom folk, there is no wrong or right, we’re just different (but you are wrong).There’s 8 flavours of fruit Chobani available. I won’t list them, I’ll let you discover them for yourself, but I can confirm I would fight to the death for the last black cherry, blood orange or pomegranate Cho in the fridge.",
        "I wasn’t such a fan of the apple & cinnamon flavour but luckily my Nan was, so they went somewhere they were appreciated. This is a woman with many decades of dessert experience, a daily consumer of the finest yoghurts available in the Co-op, and she says Chobani is delicious. There can be no higher praise!They also have a plain yoghurt in the range. There are people who can pour this on some nuts and seeds and call it breakfast. These people are slightly unhinged and should be seeking psychiatric help.",
        "However, I started adding a big dollop to my morning banana smoothie and it revolutionised an already excellent start to the day. While the fruit flavours have become a (far from occasional) treat, the plain is now a permanent addition to my fridge. Chobani also have a webpage full of recipes so anyone looking to boost their protein intake can do so easily while eating some delicious meals and snacks. So much better than throwing whey powder in to everything!So there you have it.",
        "My first (and probably last) food review. Luckily it was for something I love so it was easy to wax lyrical, but I really do recommend you get hold of some Cho and give it a try, just not the last pomegranate one from my fridge…Are you fruit at the bottom or stirred? Comment and let me know.I need to check out the recipes!",
        "Because clearly I need more excuses to eat Chobani!I am actually a lick-the-lid, fruit first person and I take a small slice out of the creamy top before trying my best to scrape all of the fruit from this small gap and then allowing myself the rest of the yoghurt. It’s the only way to eat the yoghurt. Amusement in a pot!Like a yoghurt miner, certainly sounds like a fun technique!"

        "While looking for topics to choose through in our large selection, one caught my eye immediately. When I saw the role of fathers, I knew that this would be an interesting topic to do further research on. When I have a problem with school or friends, I go to my mom. But, if I need help fixing something or wanted someone to play with when I was little, I turned to my dad. Why is that?In our Psychology book for this class, it explains in four ways how mothers and fathers differ:1.",
        "Fathers tend to be less attentive and affective when the the baby is still very little.2. Fathers tend to spend less time with the baby, even if the parents are home an equal amount.3. When fathers interact with their children, they are the more playful then mothers usually are.4. Lastly, both young boys and girls go to their father first, oppose to their mother, as a playmate.So maybe that is why many kids would go to their mom for emotional things and their dad for physical work.",
        "But you need your father just as much as you need your mother!",
        "So, I looked up some facts about Fathers that were pretty remarkable:- Odds that the average man will become a father: 1 in 2- Number yearly who take permanent leave to become stay-at-home dads: 143,000- Number of current fathers who would still want to have kids if they could do it over again: 19 in 20These are only a few, where the rest can be found here.To leave you with a small clip, fathers play a key role in the lives of his children, while some go above and beyond, the smallest gesture means a lot!This post made me think about my relationship with my parents.",
        "I tell my mom much more personal things such as problems with friends, boyfriends, and things like that where I talk to my dad about work and school and politics. There are somethings that I would NEVER tell my dad! I liked that you also did a little research and found out some more facts about fathers."

        "Bob Barker, one of the show\\u2019s hosts, had a memorable sign-off: \\u201cHoping all your consequences are happy ones.\\u201d Given how much we doubt the presentation of \\u201ctruth\\u201d in our current era, Barker\\u2019s sign-off got me thinking. For one thing, is truth still important to us, or is it a relic of the past? And for another, what are the consequences of our skepticism about what is told to us as \\u201ctrue?\\u201d \\u201cHappy\\u201d doesn\\u2019t seem to follow.",
        "We have many data points to suggest we don\\u2019t trust what we see or hear. As relates to government, a 2020 Pew study reports that across party lines, only 20% of U.S. adults trust their elected officials. Hence the joke, \\u201cHow do you know if a politician is lying?\\u201d Answer: \\u201cHis lips are moving.\\u201d And it\\u2019s not just in politics that we\\u2019ve become disbelievers. We used to trust our scientists. After all, science is steeped in research and facts. Today? Not so much.",
        "Again, Pew reports that in February 2020, only 51% of respondents hold a \\u201cfair amount\\u201d of confidence in scientists. COVID-19 has likely further eroded that percentage. So, by and large, we don\\u2019t trust the government and are cautious regarding scientists. How does social media fare? An MIT study reviewed 126,000 stories spread on Twitter, where the study\\u2019s reviewers characterized the stories as true or false based on six independent fact-checking organizations.",
        "What did the study\\u2019s co-author, Sinan Aral find? \\u201cFalsehoods travel farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth, in all categories of information, and in many cases by an order of magnitude.\\u201d This probably helps to explain why only 35% of all adults trust the political news they get on social media (Pew, 2019). This sounds like another variation of the stale joke about how the politician. How do we know if social media is lying? It\\u2019s sharing a story.",
        "It\\u2019s one thing to feel a diminished sense of truth in the people and news sources around us. It\\u2019s another to consider how lying has impacted our own personal behavior. Here\\u2019s a seemingly innocuous example.

I\\u2019ve committed this one, too. The alternative of saying nothing and letting the silence hang or saying something truthful like, \\u201cMany people are choosing to go gray\\u201d does not seem any better.",
        "There are, of course, the lies we tell that have no possible social redemption. Constructing a false online dating profile with a PhotoShopped picture is an example. I am told some people even misrepresent their marital status. There is the deceptive practice of \\u201castroturfing,\\u201d where we cook up positive reviews of a product in large amounts to facilitate adoption, such as the case of fake book reviews.",
        "All this lying \\u2014 in so many forms and degrees \\u2014 might make us feel like the ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes who is said to have lit a lamp in broad daylight as he went about looking for \\u201ca single honest man.\\u201d Where will we find our single honest man? And what are the consequences are of living in a culture where being duped is assumed. Gone are the days where we did business on a handshake or said, \\u201cI give you my word,\\u201d and it was sufficient.",
        "The consequences of lying are steep and may go as deep as a loss of self-esteem, disillusionment in our future, and more fragile relationships.

But with the support of the federal government, the American public, and local citizens, these victories could be enjoyed.During the Christmas holiday in 1949, Jo Ann Robinson, a professor at an all-Black college in Alabama, boarded a bus headed to the airport for a trip home to Ohio.Late for her flight and loaded down with gifts for family, she took a seat just behind the driver in the nearly empty bus.",

        "In Montgomery, Alabama, the WPC informed the community of each case, distributing handbills with detailed accounts of the events.Robinson's humiliating ordeal in 1949 pushed the group to seek a new plan of action, one that would be much more than informative.The WPC was quite aware of the fact that the vast majority of passengers on the city lines were African-American, and predominantly women.They felt that these facts might be the key to a successful and far-reaching bus boycott.",

        "Gayle, Robinson wrote, \"Mayor Gayle, three quarters of the riders of these public conveyances are N****es.\" She informed him of the stakes, for \"If N****es did not patronize [the buses] they could not possibly operate.\"But Robinson and the WPC understood that it would be difficult to rally the Black citizens of Alabama to risk harassment, injury, and the loss of work in protest of something that many considered simply a fact of life.They needed the right moment and the right person to represent the issue and inspire the community to take action.",
        "With the help of the NAACP, the group selected Rosa Parks, a respectable, strong-willed woman, who on the first day of December 1955, was arrested for disobeying a bus driver's orders to rise to allow a white man to sit.Parks, like many other Black citizens, had resisted these kinds of demands several times before, but this time, her act would become the rallying cry for thousands of protesters.With Parks' trial approaching, the WPC urged Jo Ann Robinson to notify the community and initiate the boycott.Robinson stayed up all night making 35,000 copies of a handbill to be distributed not only to men and women, but to school children so that they would take it home to their parents.\"This is for Monday, Dec.",

        "San Jose, California (PRWEB) June 10, 2014Follow us on LinkedIn – A part of the automated assembly line at factory floors, packaging machines are the final step in the manufacturing process. Growth in the packaging machinery industry is primarily influenced by global trade in and domestic consumption of packaged goods and changing safety and environmental legislations on packaging.",
        "End-use customer clusters are increasingly shifting to sophisticated, faster, integrated and standardized equipment in a bid to decrease packaging waste and comply with environmental standards. The food industry is forecast to remain the most important market for packaging machinery. Demand for pharmaceutical packaging machinery is expected to witness strong growth supported by the increase in new drug development and drug manufacturing activity.",
        "Shorter innovation cycles and heightened competition in most industry verticals will encourage investments in innovative packaging technologies, concepts, and machinery.Value-added packaging is the most important trend driving demand for new and efficient packaging machinery. Integrated system solutions are increasingly becoming customary because of stringent customer specifications, concerns for enhanced product quality, and mounting issues of equipment standardization.",
        "Customer preferences are shifting away from stand-alone machinery to integrated packaging equipment solutions. Other technology trends shaping market growth include increasing deployment of servos, networking architectures and robotic applications in packaging machinery. Aseptic packaging machinery and flexible packaging machinery represent two of the strongest growing product markets spearheading overall sales.",
        "The manufacturing industry’s shift from rigid packaging to flexible packaging is helping spur growth in the flexible packaging machinery market. The growing importance of high-end graphics on packaging, ease of use and dispensing of the product, lightweight, and strong barrier properties represent factors driving adoption of flexible packaging.",
        "Pharmaceutical and food packaging are major end-users of flexible packaging machinery.The ability to meet sterile packaging needs of the pharmaceutical industry and offer cost benefits in distribution and storage of food products and beverages is driving growth in the aseptic packaging machinery market.As stated by the new market research report on Packaging Machinery, Asia-Pacific represents the largest and the fastest growing regional market worldwide with a CAGR of 8.4% over the analysis period.",
        "Large-scale shift in consumer spending on value-added products, population growth, booming retail industry, changing life-styles, economic prosperity and increased consumption of durable and non-durable goods, are factors driving growth in the region.Major players covered in the report include Adelphi Masterfil Ltd., Barry-Wehmiller Companies Inc., Accraply, Bosch Packaging Technology, Bradman Lake Group, Coesia SpA, Harland Machine Systems Ltd., IMA SpA, KHS USA Inc., Krones AG, Orion Packaging Systems, Tetra Laval International S.A, Tetra Pak Inc., Weber Marking Systems Inc.",

        "It’s a treatise on a life in a constant state of war by Thomas Hobbes (1588 – 1679).I like Hobbes for four reasons: he writes about ‘warre’ because spelling had not been invented, his name makes me think about ‘Quatermass and the Pit’, this adjectival clause was adapted by Jon Pertwee’s Doctor to introduce the Sontarans in 1973 (or the middle ages depending on your view), and the applicability of his sad philosophy to the modern cyberman.This missive is an observation from someone who teaches security in mould-breaking classes where at least half are women, and many of those women come from patriarch-based religious backgrounds.10 of my 15 MSc research students on cyber projects last year were women.",
        "Actually I hate pointing it out. The only students I feel uncomfortable with are those who can’t work up a passion for the subject. So…don’t talk to me about stereotypes. I just like the term ‘cyberman’; the ‘Jon Pertwee’ reference should vouch for me; geek or nerd...epithets borne with pride. Anyway, if you prick me, do I not bleed?It’s early in the day and it’s late in the year.",
        "I may still be persuaded to create a few sound-bite predictions but only if I feel it will be another arrow for my bow of cyber security evangelism. Sellars and Yateman remind us that for everyone wanting to teach you can find approximately 30 not wanting to learn.",
        "I should know; I’m blessed with 60‑70 students in each class.Then there were the two decades served at one of our late, great, national institutions where the cynicism of the employees sent on a security course made the mark-scrabbling expectations of students who want to be spoon-fed positively refreshing. I remember the feedback forms…Q. Why did you attend this course? A. My manager sent me.Q. Who else in your organisation will benefit from this course? A. My manager.",
        "Sigh.By the end of it most were a fifth column of further evangelists enjoying group therapy. I’m still in touch with many of them today.It would seem that the instant gratification society where people ‘just Google it’ (other search engines are available) has created expectations of a quick answer for everything without a care for whether it’s correct because you can always apportion blame (or possibly guilt) to the source.",
        "After all, 80 years ago if you read it in Der Stürmer… There is no quick gratification for security, it is a state of grace in the cybernetic sense.The sad conundrum is that in the cyber field, you need learn so much yet hit the ground running. At the same time, you need to remember the reverse of Ranum’s sixth observation that action is not always better than inaction.",
        "If you rely on learning everything first, Alice will still be telling Bob about the lack of pictures and conversations whilst Eve harvests the apples of their intellectual property.This reminds me of the IISP experience with its Top Gun company v. hacker exercises. Whilst the have-a-go hackers get down to probing and exploiting, the company role players get down to forming committees.",
        "If you are going to inform busy people about cyber security then books brimming with useful information are likely to have the structure of the proverbial chocolate teapot after the boiling water has been added. Take some Gawande-like lessons from the standards whose taxonomies can be infinitely debated but at least they’ve been compiled.Of course you can’t turn a cowering executive into the all-knowledgeable with a Vulcan mind-meld.",
        "You need to structure the learning to make the delegation of responsibility (the first principle of governance) easy to assign. It pains me to say it, but a bluffers guide may be effective. Your briefings must marry pinstripes to pony tails and replace the à la carte with the contents of a pizza box. And find wisdom where you can. I cannot help but be reminded of the Tommy Cooper classic where he's demonstrating how he learnt to SCUBA dive.",
        "He's swimming with one hand because he's got the instruction book in the other. Criminals don’t wait for the instructions.Slice and dice your security learning with a few charts and graphs and dashboards. Information measurements to be interpreted will either have no time to be interpreted, be ignored because of their daunting density, or misinterpreted in accordance with Murphy's Law.",
        "We need cautionary tales of ToR and other Dark Net denizens to help us climb out of the dark ourselves…so pertinent at this time of year.Now is the winter of our protective monitoring brought into glorious summer by the emphasis on resilience and the temptation of the punitive hack back...our cyber environment should be riven with such philosophies with a big side order of forensic readinessUse standards wisely.",
        "Standards are wonderful distillations of human knowledge but like all tools they are made for a purpose. ISO/IEC 15408 is a product standard; ISO/IEC 27001 is a process standard.

        ".You can adapt this chicken curry with coconut milk recipe in many different ways to suit your palates and I have mentioned some variations below, while I explain the flow of how I make it. If you use canned or packaged coconut milk, this is a very easy dish to put together in under 30 mins. Making your own coconut milk will obviously elevate the flavour of the curry but it's not essential in this dish, in my opinion.",

Heat oil in a wide pan and add the sliced onions. Fry until golden brown (they need to brown a bit more than in the picture below).2. Grind the green chillies, garlic, and ginger together coarsely.3.",
        "Add the spice powders - chilli, coriander, cumin, and turmeric - to the fried onions. Saute for 20 seconds.4. Now add the ground chilli paste and tomatoes to the above. Fry again for a minute, the mixture will turn fragrant.5. Add the cleaned chicken pieces to this,along with the thin coconut milk + 1 more cup of water. Add salt. Bring this to boil.6. Meanwhile, grind the soaked poppy seeds in 2-3 tbsp water into a smooth paste.",
        "I use the same grinder as I used for chilli paste.Add poppy seed paste to the curry and when it comes to boil, lower heat and cook closed for 15-20 mins or until the chicken pieces are cooked. The gravy will also thicken a bit.7.",
        "On low heat, add the thick coconut milk and mix well..Serve hot!Variations and Notes:- You can add more tomatoes if you want or omit it completely- If you want a 'whiter' curry, omit the chilli powder and increase amount of green chillies, to taste- I use poppy seeds as a gravy thickener.",
        "Other options are to use cashew nut paste (soaked cashew nuts ground with water) or more thick coconut milk or coconut cream- You can use curry leaves as garnish instead of coriander leaves but avoid using both- You can try this same recipe with chicken pieces with bone. It's hard for me to find that kind cleaned and prepared so I always opt for chicken breast.",
        "Adjust cooking time according to size of chicken pieces- You can make a vegetarian version of this curry by substituting chicken with soya chunks, potatoes, or a mixture of both. A mix of vegetables may also turn out well- Regarding thin and thick coconut milk - if using canned coconut milk, buy full cream variety (not the low fat or whatever) and for the 2 cups thin milk, dilute with 1:1 water. When you need to add the thick coconut milk, add it as is. Check this post if making coconut milk at home"

        "SXSW Day Four: Rosay's Legs Must Be Tiredby Marc HawthorneMarch 19th, 2007After three days of bands, bands, bands, the last day of SXSW is usually a good time to hang out with people you haven’t had time to see and be a little more selective about which shows you attend, since you’re usually about four bad songs away from swearing off live music forever.",
        "However, this year the final day of the festival is packed with lots of bands that are either exciting or potentially exciting, so I decide to spend most of the afternoon and evening on my own, hoping to see a few things that will blow my mind. outside stage and I’m enjoying it, but it’s probably just because I find myself developing a huge crush on the singer.",
        "A writer friend says that another writer friend knows her, but I’ve got bands to see and I’m probably old enough to be her dad.3:04pm: Standing in a huge line to get into the Fader Fort, I realize that I should have known better than to arrive at showtime to see the Damon Albarn-fronted The Good, The Bad & The Queen.",
        "From the outside, the band sounds good but not incredibly exciting (kind of like the album), and it’s clear I’m never making it inside, so it’s off to Filter’s “High Noon At Cedar Street” event I go.3:59pm: In the Cedar Street Courtyard, I see Rose Pipette walking around, and realize that if I hadn’t bothered to stand in the line to see Damon, I probably could have seen The Pipettes. Strike two.",
        "Mando Diao are playing pretty catchy garage rock, but I can’t wait for them to leave so I can see Mew.5:47pm: Mew has just proven that it’s the best thing since sliced bread with a set that mostly focuses on the epic-rock sweetness found on And The Glass Handed Kites. Mew is also ruining my ability to enjoy the garage-y stylings of The Fratellis, also known as That Band With The Song In The IPod Commercial.",
        "What they’re doing just seems so pedestrian compared to the tower of sound created by Mew, though “Flathead” (the iPod song) is undeniably infectious.8:01pm: On the Beauty Bar Patio, Orenda Fink of Azure Ray fame sounds less mysterious with her band Art In Manila than she did on her 2005 solo album.",
        "I’m happy to see Adrienne from The Anniversary doing something in no way related to the bad classic rock it pooped out on its swan song, but I’ve still got Mew on my mind…9:22pm: At La Zona Rosa, I’m breaking my don’t-see-any-band-twice rule as Mew is now creating its gorgeous soundscapes with a video in the background.",
        "Clearly I’m obsessed, since I’ve decided to leave the ridiculously small Beauty Bar Patio, where The Pipettes are on at 11…10:31pm: After wading through all the potential St. Pat’s troublemakers on Fourth Street, we make it back to the Beauty Bar, and sure enough, the line to get in is huge, and to top it all off, the alley smells like garbage and outhouses. Probably has something to with all those Dumpsters and outhouses.",
        "Tilly And The Wall look good but only sound half as good from outside the venue, and for some reason it doesn’t appear they’re interested in playing their best song, “Bad Education.” If you haven’t seen their performance on Letterman, YouTube it right now.11:31pm: After being sure that I had missed my final chance to see Rose, I finally get back inside to see The Pipettes, whose throwback girl-group pop is even better live than it is on record.",
        "Probably has something to do with how incredibly attractive Rosay (that’s what her necklace says, so I guess I’ll stop calling her Rose) is, and how incredibly cute all the dancing is.",
        "No, this music isn’t going to change your life, but it sure does make living a whole lot more fun.1:01am: Instead of taking the advice of Rosie Thomas—who gave me a good-friends hug yesterday at Maggie Mae’s after I told her how much I like her new record, even though it was the first time we’d ever spoken—and going to see the super-buzzed Midlake at Buffalo Billiards, I’ve just broken my don’t-see-any-band-twice rule again by sticking around to see Tokyo Police Club, who don’t sound anything like The Strokes this time around, and though I want to stay for Cursive, I choose to follow the Tag Team folks to the Blender party, where I’m about to see Tokyo Police Club for the third time.5:15am: 5:15 a.m.",

        "Once upon a time…We are a group of old friends who had worked together for many years. One afternoon we were having a beer in a brew pub and were tired from a hard day’s work…no really! We looked around and saw the fun and enjoyment that the brew-pub patrons were experiencing and, frankly, the beer was great too. One. But there’s more to the story…After liking this name, we looked back in Ottawa’s history for where it came from.",
        "All the way back, in fact, to Philemon Wright, who is credited as being the first permanent settler in the Ottawa area (I know, we all said, “who would name their kid Philemon” …but keep reading, it’s a good story). Within a few years of his arrival in 1800, the new settlement apparently had mills to make flour, cut lumber, process hemp and make potash. Philemon would later branch into mining and cement-making and become a justice of the peace, a road builder and a hotelier.",
        "Philemon was quite the entrepreneur.Continuing the history lesson, the name “Hog’s Back” was first coined to describe a section of the Rideau River where a ridge of limestone was cresting the river, looking like the backbone of a hog. This area of the river became a critical location in the building of the Rideau Canal for canal builder Colonel John By, who identified in 1827 the need to build a large dam to raise the river water and create what is now Mooney’s Bay.",
        "The main story at Hog’s Back became the building of the dam, and the contract to build this dam was awarded to, who else, Philemon Wright and Sons, by now lumber barons. Building the dam at Hog’s Back was a tremendous engineering challenge, which was critical to the completion of the Rideau Canal and resulted in what is now Hog’s Back Falls.So, just what is the beer connection to Hog’s Back Falls and Philemon Wright?",
        "Well, we have it on very good authority that when kicking back after a long day building dams at Hog’s Back Falls, Philemon enjoyed a good beer, having also established the very first brewery in the Ottawa Valley. It is also reputed that he sold hops to a young John Molson back in the day…now there’s a connection to beer!The HogsBack Brewing Company salutes the entrepreneurship of Philemon Wright and the challenges he overcame.",
        "We plan to embody that spirit as we launch our own brewing establishment to bring back a traditional approach to hand-crafted beer in the Ottawa Valley. The HogsBack Brewing Company offers a traditionally brewed craft beer alternative to the standard industrial beer from who knows where.",
        "And, most importantly, the HogsBack Brewing Company is owned and operated by four local guys – Frank, Jerry, Mark and Paige, with a goal to provide the finest-flavoured beer using all-natural ingredients and traditional small-batch brewing. Give us a try and let us know what you think.Cheers!"

Click here to see even more.From the bride… Andrio and I have covered a lot of ground in our relationship. We met while both living in Seattle, started our relationship commuting between Philly and New York and finally got engaged on the same Manhattan rooftop where we shared our first kiss after I relocated to New York.",
        "We knew we wanted our wedding to be a celebration of the two of us and the things we hold most dear. With Andrio’s family near Portland, Oregon and mine from outside of Detroit, planning a wedding in either of our hometowns felt too far removed from the other’s roots.",
        "We opted to host the event in New York, our current hometown, and use it as an excuse to bring everyone together and give them a little taste of the things we love most about being New Yorkers.Both of us being designers (Caroline is a textile designer in the fashion industry and Andrio is a graphic designer), we wanted to find a space that would allow us to put our own special spin on the look and feel of the day.",
        "We wanted an event that was intimate, casually sophisticated and filled with warm candlelight, wonderful wine and food. The venue also had to allow dogs, as we wanted our long-haired dachshund, Marlow, to act as ring-bearer for the ceremony (he literally dragged the flower girl down the aisle on the day of). When we discovered The Foundry in Long Island City, we knew we had found our spot.",
        "From the beginning we agreed to keep the color palette very simple — just shades of white, ivory and gray to soften the New York industrial interior of The Foundry with rustic elements to remind us of the Oregon Coast where Andy grew up vacationing and we have shared many happy trips to together.Both of us coming from very close-knit families, Andy and I knew from the start that we wanted to create our reception menu to pair with wines from The Grade Cellars, a vineyard owned and operated by my uncle and aunt in Napa Valley.",

        "Shaun also helped to include some additional personal items into the menu such as serving mini lumpia (a traditional Filipino snack since Andrio’s family is from the Philippines) during the cocktail hour as well as helping us recreate the famous Pecan Pie Sundae from Buttermilk Channel, our favorite Brooklyn restaurant. My father said that the only thing wrong with the wedding was that it ended too soon.",

Well check-out the trailer for Kamen Rider Ghost: The Legend Of The Hero Alain.This series of specials (4 episodes in total) that will be included in the Kamen Rider ghost Blu-ray set that will be relased in April 13th focuses on Alain's point of view on what it's like to be a human.",

Would this be canon and show him as a redeeming character, or simply affirm his role as a villain when it ends.",
        "I mean, wow, he hangs out with the Ghost gang. Seriously, they didn't even recognize him?We'll see what happens when it comes out and gets subbed.the katakana written a-ra-n, so its should be aran/alan not alainBut he's not a hero, he's a villianSince people are being stupid already, I believe the point of Alain as we're now calling him is that he's a hero in his own mind and from our perspective as humans following the hero of Ghost he would be a villain but what he's doing isn't wrong for his people.",

He's probably gonna be an aloof ally who struggles with betraying his kind or his own friendships and relationships he develops with humans.i hope he stays a hero because if he does maybe he won't die or it could be chase again?This seems like something sad in the end is going to happen, I'm looking forward to thisLet's just say he's an anti-hero for now.",

If that's what's Toei says, who are we to argue?But Kamen rider likes to give its villains redeeming qualities. Plus if you think about it, in a battle of people from opposing worlds, there are no heroes or villains, it is merely a battle of ideals.",
        "Aran's ideals are that individual life and physical bodies mean nothing, mostly because as a ganma he never had a need for such things. Takeru and by extension the human race find this to be evil because that is how our world is. Villains and heroes don't exist. As said by Kamen rider sangou, \" If you you lose you are labeled by history as evil.\"I think it is."

The nest material was crushed using mortar and pestle to obtain a fine powder.",

The samples were scanned over a sampling range of 2.5 to 70°2θ with a step size of 0.0066 and a scan speed of 0.023°2θ per second. For each nest, triplicate samples were used for bulk analyses and duplicate samples for separated clay fraction analyses with and without chemical treatment.",
        "As the clay particles (<2 μm in size) generally do not show clear diffraction patterns in bulk samples with random orientation, the clay fraction was separated from the bulk sample upon dispersion of the powder using an ultrasonic bath. Centrifugation of the samples at 1000 rpm for 2 min was used to separate the heavier fraction, whereas the clay was left in suspension.",
        "The clay suspended fluid was then put on glass rounds, the clay was allowed to settle, and the material was left to dry to generate oriented mounts for XRD analysis. The air-dried clay fraction samples and glycol-solvated clay fraction samples were used to identify different clays present in the samples.",
        "Moreover, some clay fractions were treated with 1 N HCl to confirm the absence of chlorite in the samples.The diffraction analyses on the bulk samples of both nests show peaks of quartz (45); however, the Guinea sample also shows the presence of kaolinite and hematite (fig. S1). The XRD analysis on the separated clay fraction shows peaks of kaolinite and smectite in the Senegal sample and peaks of kaolinite and illite in the Guinea samples.",
        "The integrated intensities of the characteristic peaks were used for quantification of the relative mineral abundance in the samples. Separated fractions of different minerals are reported in table S1."

Angela & Evan Photography captured every moment so we could spend the afternoon getting inspired by all the pretty, and you can see it all in the full gallery of images!From the Bride...",
        "John and I met at a friend's wedding in September 2007, where John was a groomsman. He was so adorable in his tux that I could not resist asking him to dance. Nearly four years later, John proposed on the balcony of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, B.C, and of course, I said “yes.” On one of our early dates John and I went wine tasting in Woodinville, Washington, and happened to witness the arrival of a wedding party at Novelty Hill Januik Winery.",
        "John remembers saying, “Maybe one day we’ll get married here.” To which I, trying not to tip my hand too early, replied, “No way.” But when the time came to pick a venue, Novelty Hill Januik was the perfect location. Not only was it in Woodinville, where John grew up, and just a few miles from Seattle where I grew up, but it reminded us of all the fun times we had already shared ... oh, and the wine is really tasty!",
        "With the indispensable help of Novelty Hill’s wedding coordinator Emily Pollock, we set about organizing a ceremony and reception that was laid-back but highlighted the modern beauty and intimacy of the winery. The winery’s modern but warm feel were the inspiration for the day. All of the stationery was ordered through Costco and then embellished by me and my mom. We wrapped the raised print pocket fold invitations with a belly band of yellow and gold paper and then tied them with blue satin ribbon.",
        "We really wanted our guests to feel like they were opening a present when the invitation arrived.I had always dreamed of a fall wedding, and Novelty Hill’s garden area, lined with trees and leaves changing color, really made the day feel like fall. All I had to say to Meghan Stoller of Mum Floral Design was ”I love succulents,” and Meghan went about creating some of the most beautiful bouquets and arrangements I have ever seen.",
        "She was even able to incorporate a handkerchief, given to John at his birth, and my grandmother’s rosary into the handle of the my bouquet. To top off her attention to detail, Meghan located the paper my mom and I had used on the invitations and wrapped it around the boxes the flower girls carried down the aisle. The ceremony was performed by Judge Tabor, one of my former bosses and mentor. His ceremony brought everyone to tears — several times.",
        "Having someone so dear perform the ceremony, while being surrounded by our friends and family, really made the day special and focused on our expression of love and commitment to each other.After the ceremony, guests enjoyed a wine and tray-passed hors d'oeuvres period before the dinner buffet was opened, where they were served a delicious meal of locally-sourced vegetables, salmon, and beef tenderloin. For a late night snack, the kitchen re-opened and guests were served wood-fired pizzas.",
        "We wanted our guests to spread out and mingle, so we decided to forgo place cards and instead decided to use a mix of small, large and tall tables. We used the mantel above the open fireplace to display photographs of our family members who could not join us. And instead of a guest book, we asked our guests to sign their names to a wedding tree, which we plan to hang in our entry way. John is a huge Star Wars fan.",
        "During the planning process he would frequently ask, “When do we get the Leia and Han cake toppers?” So I knew he would be floored when he saw the Millennium Falcon groom's cake I ordered. Mike’s Amazing Cake’s did not disappoint. Not only was the Millennium Falcon’s detail spot on (reportedly the only cake to make the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs), the chocolate with salted caramel filled cake was delicious.",

        "Organizations spent nearly 23 percent more on cybersecurity in 2017 than 2016 — on average about $11.7 million, according to figures from Accenture. Their figures also find the average cost of a malware attack on a company is $2.4 million.Breach costs are also risingThe annual 2018 Cost of a Data Breach Study from IBM Security and Ponemon Institute finds the global average cost of a data breach is $3.86 million, up 6.4 percent from 2017.",
        "Each lost or stolen record costs a company $148 per record.Breaches are also getting larger and more serious annually. In early December we learned about the whopping 500 million customers potentially impacted by the breach suffered by hotel giant Marriott. Some of the compromised data on guests includes names, phone numbers, email addresses, passport numbers and dates of birth.",
        "Credit card numbers and expiration dates on some also may have been exposed.When it comes to the cost of breaches by nation, the US tops the list with a $7.91 million average cost for a breach, with Canada and Germany right behind the US. Moreover, this trend shows no signs of slowing down.Most losses suffered in a cyberattack are never recoveredAccording to a recent article in PC World, 68 percent of funds lost as a result of a cyberattack were declared unrecoverable.",
        "The article goes on to note the average time to detect a malicious or criminal attack was 170 days – nearly six months!This brings us back to the Marriott breach. Officials with Marriott said they had been warned by a security alert in September about an attempt to access the Starwood Hotels reservation database in the US. They took action and investigated – and found out a criminal had had unauthorized access to the Starwood database for four years – since 2014!",
        "Four years is plenty of time to do maximum damage and steal countless amounts of sensitive information.Insider threats can cost millionsInsider breaches are among the most expensive and toughest to detect.",
        "According to Ponemon Institute, the average cost of insider threats to a business is more than $8 million, and 59 percent of employees steal proprietary corporate data when they quit or are fired.According to the 2018 IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index, two-thirds of total data records compromised last year were the result of inadvertent insiders. Insider threats are the cause of 75 percent of security breach incidents by some accounts.",
        "Recent research from Forrester reveals more than half of global network security decision makers whose firms had suffered a data breach in the past 12 months had experienced at least one insider incident.Human error is responsible for many incidentsWhile many security incidents are malicious, there are also a large percentage due simply to human error and employee negligence.Prior to Marriott, last year’s massive, headline-making breach was suffered by Equifax, which exposed the records of nearly 146 million Americans and was reported to be the result of one employee’s error.",
        "How? According to Congressional testimony given by former Equifax CEO Richard F.",
        "Smith, an “individual” in Equifax’s technology department neglected to heed security warnings and did not ensure the implementation of software fixes that would have prevented the breach.A report from Experian titled Managing Insider Risk Through Training and Culture Report found 66 percent of the data protection and privacy training professionals surveyed considered employees the “weakest link” when it came to cyber security.Proper Segregation of Duties (SoD) can reduce internal fraud and mistakesMany businesses are overlooking Segregation of Duties (SoD) as part of their security strategy.",
        "SoD is one of the most obvious controls to minimize insider threats. According to Gartner’s 2017 Market Guide, effective segregation of duties controls can reduce the risk of internal fraud by up to 60 percent, and some of the largest corporate fraud cases in history have been the result a lack of SoD controls.A talent shortage is only going to make things harderThe skills gap and talent shortage in the security industry is well documented.",
        "An estimated 3.5 million cybersecurity positions will be unfilled by 2021, according to a 2017 report from Cybersecurity Ventures.In what many are calling an “industry crisis,” hiring managers are desperately looking for security talent and need to get creative. In the meantime, criminals are getting more sophisticated and keeping them at bay is only going to get more difficult as the talent shortage stresses security departments.",
        "In the absence of skilled people to fill jobs, organizations will increasingly look to automation and tools to supplement their security strategy.Final factsThese statistics are sobering, so is the rise of concern around the globe that has brought about legislation to place more of the onus on senior managers and executives for security breaches, fraud and mishaps.",
        "The UK’s Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR) puts more personal liability for governance, risk and compliance on the shoulders of key senior employees. If you want to learn more about this, we’ve written about it here: “Will Emerging Legislation on Internal Controls Make You Personally Liable?”Variations of the same law are cropping up elsewhere in countries such as Australia and Singapore.",
        "And after the Equifax and Marriott incidents, government officials in the US have pressed for new legislation that would levy civil penalties for private sector violations.Will putting more executive skin in the game help businesses to take cybersecurity more seriously? That remains to be seen, but what is starkly evident is the need to keep cybersecurity at the forefront of corporate priorities."

        "The press made a great deal of noise about General Motors Co.’s (NYSE: GM) decision to test Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) as an advertising medium. When the car company walked away from the social media giant more than a year ago, it was viewed as a sign of the ineffectiveness of Facebook as a marketing tool. The decision had little meaning at all. GM’s ad commitment a year ago was $10 million, and its new test is probably for a sum much less than that.Facebook’s revenue in 2012 was $5.1 billion.",
        "Some analysts expect that number to move about $7 billion this year. According to research by Business Insider, the largest advertisers on Facebook spend many, many times what GM spent, even when its investment was $10 million. These marketers include AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T), Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG), American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT).",
        "Either GM is behind the curve in its adoption of social networks as an effective ad tool, or car marketing does not work as well on Facebook as marketing for consumer goods, retail and credit cards.GM’s budget for Facebook never made any difference to the social network’s success, any more than if a large advertiser did not use newspapers, radio or television.",
        "Big corporations have reasons why they think one medium works better than another, depending on the message the want to send, the creative execution they use and their demographic targets.",
        "If GM wants to adopt Facebook as a medium, it may be as much because it has decided that, for some products, during some periods, social networks are more effective than, say, TV.Just as marketers move from television to print, to online banner ads, to social media, an investment in Facebook as a marketing medium may have no more relevance than the fickle nature of how companies sell products and services."

        "I first encountered the idea of frame of reference while an undergrad studying Physics. To the man walking down the aisle of the airplane, he’s walking a few miles per hour. From the frame of reference of someone on the ground, he’s walking several hundred miles per hour. Frame of reference refers to the myriad ways we can see the same activity. In Hatha Yoga, there are relatively few positions, though each position may relate to gravity in many different ways.",
        "Sometimes the best way to learn a given posture is to study that form in a different context.When I first began my studies of Yoga, I was taught to lift the chest and pull the shoulders back when standing in Mountain Pose. In observing the epidemic of poor posture, this was a logical instruction. What was interesting to note, however, was how rarely this instruction led to any degree of comfort in the body.",
        "Yes, it momentarily corrected poor posture, though the benefits were often short-lived and the practitioner usually looked ill-at-ease. In many ways, the poor posture seemed more authentic, as there was less of a contrived quality.Virtually all of us have caught sight of our reflection in a mirror or window and were shocked to see how pitched forward our head and shoulders were.",
        "Our motivation to correct this imbalanced state is well-founded, though changing the frame of reference usually yields the best results. I’ve found learning how to stand best happens on the floor. As a result, I’ve come to teach Prone Mountain far more often than I teach Mountain Pose (Tadasana).Prone Mountain begins, as the name implies, on the belly. Start with your hands flat on the floor with your wrists beside the lower ribs.",
        "Many people find their head falling into the floor, while their chest is off the floor – this is the head-forward posture revealing itself. To build better posture, bring your chest as close as possible to the floor (flesh of the chest firm against the floor) while simultaneously lifting your nose and chin slightly off the floor. To fully realize the benefits for the spine, extend out through the crown of the head, while at the same time, stretching back through the outstretched toes.",
        "By practicing Prone Mountain in this way, you gently remind the body of its optimal spinal alignment, while building the core postural strength to help maintain good posture.The next step is to find ease and comfort in the shoulders. The shoulders mirror the state of the lungs. If the shoulders are rounded forward, the lungs are often too cool. If the shoulders are pulled back too much, the lungs are often overheated. One is not preferable to the other – they’re both imbalances.",
        "As with most natural systems, there is a middle way that best serves the system. Prone Mountain pose helps us find the middle way of optimal health.Return to Prone Mountain and find the optimal spinal alignment we explored earlier, and bring your attention to the shoulders. Very often at the very mention of shoulders, people reflexively pull them back to the spine. Yes, the chest is more open, but at what cost to the back lungs? Remember: the torso is three-dimensional.",
        "Opening the chest by compressing the back is a zero net gain. The optimal posture opens both front lungs and back lungs at the same time.To do this, simply think of broadening across the place where the arm inserts into the shoulder socket. (It can be useful to have someone press on the posterior deltoid to provide feedback.) You know you’re on the right track when both upper back and chest feel broad and spacious, and you can feel the rhythmic movement of breathing in both your front and back.",
        "Don’t worry about keeping the elbows drawn in tight to your torso – in the big picture, it’s not the most important element.When you practice Prone Mountain, the first step is to find the optimal spinal alignment. Once you’ve found this optimal alignment and created extension in the spine, find the optimal shoulder alignment such that both front and back lungs are involved with the breathing. Let this feeling seep into your body-mind for one-five minutes.",
        "You’ll likely feel the benefits of Prone Mountain once you come up on your feet into Tadasana. Your body will remember optimal alignment once it’s had the taste.This is the first installment of Prone Mountain and Optimal Posture. Next time we’ll cover the relationship of the spine to the fore/aft body, and how the Spine Bag helps resolve long-standing postural imbalances.",

        "LAS VEGAS (JTA) — The recently released study of the impact of Birthright Israel trips should be very welcome news for the Jewish people.Ever since the release of the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey, experts have been seeking ways to maximize Jewish continuity.",
        "Quite simply, this new study, conducted by Brandeis University’s Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies, shows that the Birthright Israel program represents a truly effective way to change the course of Jewish history.Now that we have this research, increasing the number of Birthright Israel participants should become a top priority of Jewish philanthropy.We cannot take credit for coming up with the idea for Birthright Israel, which offers a free 10-day trip to Israel for Jews ages 18 to 26; that distinction goes to Michael Steinhardt and Charles Bronfman.",
        "Despite opposition from many skeptics, these visionary philanthropists persisted in making their creative idea a reality starting in 2000.When we were approached to support Birthright Israel at the end of 2006, it appeared to us to be a transformative program based on the anecdotal evidence we heard.Now there is research that validates our impression: The Birthright Israel experience significantly increases participants’ connections to Israel and the Jewish people, rates of in-marriage and the value placed on raising Jewish children, among other desirable outcomes.In the past three years, our family has been privileged to help Birthright Israel demonstrate the scalability of this remarkable program by committing more than $90 million to increase the number of participants.Last year more than 40,000 young adults went on Birthright Israel trips.",
        "If the program can achieve that rate for several years, we will come close to reaching a majority of young Jews.This becomes a real tipping point that can transform an entire generation. With so many demographic and geopolitical forces arrayed against our people and the Jewish state, increasing the number of Birthright Israel participants should be a no-brainer.By no means are we understating the importance of other formal and informal means of promoting Jewish continuity.",
        "But in Birthright Israel we have a proven product that can be targeted at young adults who are the least affiliated with our community and constitute a rapidly growing segment of the Jewish population. Birthright Israel can provide effective “booster shots” for Jewish continuity for less than $3,000 per person.Maintaining a level of 40,000 participants per year will be an enormous challenge. It means a budget of more than $100 million per year.",
        "To date, the program has benefited from very generous support from the government of Israel, and we hope that support will continue to grow.The benefits to Israel are clear — most of the Birthright Israel dollars are spent there.",
        "Even more important, however, is a strengthening of Israel’s base of support in the Diaspora, not to mention the Birthright alumni who make aliyah.Federations, foundations and individual philanthropists also have played an important role in the program’s growth, but it is time to significantly expand the number of players and ramp up the level of support.The recently released study confirms the tremendous potential of Birthright Israel as a proven and simple way to use our charitable dollars to strengthen the Jewish people and the Jewish state.We hope you will join us by putting this extraordinary program at the top of your charitable list, and together we can literally change the course of Jewish history.(Dr.",

        "Simulated labs and hospital rooms mimic “patients” having real-life situations from cardiac arrest to a woman giving birth.But before attendees looked inside, WC President Dr. Kevin Eaton, Frank Martin, Board of Trustees Chairman, and Bob Glenn, WC Foundation President, said a few words highlighting the many people who helped make the $6 million project possible.“This is another huge day for Weatherford College,” Eaton said.",
        "“We always strive to put the students first and this building accomplishes that.”Eaton then touted the raising of $2.4 million in the Foundation’s capital campaign, spoke about how the project came in under budget and on-time and praised past and present board members for their vision of what they want WC to be.",
        "He added that with furniture and equipment, the cost of the building was less than $188 per square-foot.“Our mission is to provide effective learning opportunities that enrich the lives of our students and the communities we serve,” Eaton said.",
        "“I truly believe that all of the capital projects we have completed over the past four years have done just that.”Martin agreed and said that every accomplishment the college celebrates just proves that WC is a place to be recognized.“[This is a] quality place to get educated,” he said.He then introduced two Allied Health students, both married with children, who are taking classes at the college - Shannon Coble and Dennis Maguth.Coble is in the LVN to RN program and said how grateful she was for the innovative new labs.",
        "Maguth, a sonography student, said the “Cadillac of a building” gives him a sense of pride.“As we come up the hill and see the Don Allen Health Science Building, there’s a great sense of pride,” he said. “It’s a great time to be a student.”Glenn took time to give special thanks to Jerry and Vickie Durant, whose $400,000 donation was the largest the Foundation received toward the new building.",

        "Students were on hand in each room to talk about the particular benefit of that area.At the “hospital,” for example, lab assistant Mary Knickerbocker controls each of the SimMan patients - life-like mannequins that blink, talk, cough and interact with the students based on what they instructor wants them to focus on that day.“We have four adults, one child and a birthing one where a woman has a child,” she explained.",
        "“There is even a crash cart if that’s the situation the instructor chooses.”One particular “patient” was set up for students later in the day to work on who mimicked hypothermia, complete with blue fingertips and a blue nose. When students arrive, Knickerbocker will program the patient’s reactions from a computer screen.“This helps them with their clinical experience and take what they’ve learned in the classroom and apply it,” Knickerbocker said.",
        "“It’s better to make a mistake in here than in the real world.”There is also a basic skills area where students can request medicines and supplies for patients when needed, just as they would do in a hospital.Another upstairs lab area simulates a triage in an emergency room. During Thursday’s tour, a student was sewing up a wound on the stomach of a mannequin. There were also clinical areas for patient consultations for those who may work in home health and doctor’s offices.",
        "Downstairs, phlebotomy students can learn to draw blood from patients with “arms” that are attached to fake blood bags.During the tour, several students from the various Allied Health programs touted how much better the new labs were and thanked everyone for attending and contributing to their future."

The mandate extended to GA with the closure of the mid continent (Loran) gap in 1986.",

        "Nevertheless Paul’s unique achievements, in the process of discovery and invention, was a major contribution to the development of a stable and reliable National Loran Network, in the US; and worldwide. Paul’s fertile mind extended the vision and applied the necessary resources to develop and to make the Loran network the terrestrial equivalent of GPS or as a backup absent GPS.",
        "Erik Johannessen, President of Megapulse accepted the honors on behalf of the Loran communities, provided the historical context in the development of the technology and spoke of the splendid collaborative effort of the many to deliver important (new) capabilities in the design and development of the ‘next generation’ eLoran PNT&C equipment and services to make Paul’s vision reality.By Ivan Berger for IEEE.orgOne breakthrough from the 19th century and three originating in 20th-century defense research were recognized in June as IEEE Milestones in Electrical Engineering and Computing.:.[Read about the rest of the award recipients…]"

        "The backing should not pull severely when clamped.Terminology: ( you said you only have 3 rollers so you do not have a leveling roller)Take-Up roller is at the back of the machine. It is the one \"inside\" the throat of the machine. Your quilt backingwill be zipped onto this roller. Your entire quilt will be 'taken up' on this rollerBelly roller is the one that touches your belly from the front of the machine.",
        "The bottom of your quilt backing will be rolled onto this roller.The middle roller will hold the zippered bottom of the quilt top unless you float your quilt.Full float means no zippers are used on the quilt top.Zippers.... you will love them once you get the procedure down.I float my quilt top so I don't use the zipper marked \"quiltop bottom left\".",
        "Before I began floating my quilts, I would baste (or pin) the bottom of the quilt top to the third zipper half also using my Domestic Sewing Machin (DSM).Then I carry the pieces to my longarm.-Zip the backing onto the take-up and belly rollers (top and bottom)-Roll the backing onto the belly roller smoothing out puckers and wrinkles. Leave some slack in backing. The back-side of the backing should be face up.- Zip the bottom of the quilt top onto the middle roller.",
        "Roll it completely onto the roller to keep it out of the way for now. (Skip this step for a full float).-Place the batting on top of the quilt backing as close to the top of the backing as you can get it. You may want to pin it every 6\". You will be basting this batting on so do not pin close to the top. With the top of the batting pinned to the top of the of the backing, smooth the batting along the width of the quilt and finesse the batting between the middle roller and the belly roller.",
        "Smooth it gently. The batting (and quilt top if floated) drapes over the belly roller and falls to the floor (depending on length; it is loose).Tighten the belly roller carefully smoothing the batting on top too and set the brake (right front) on the belly roller. Do not make this tight or you will break thread when you quilt. You're not supposed to be able to bounce a quarter off the quilt-Slowly baste the batting to the backing. Remove the pins from the batting/backing.",
        "Release the brake.- Lay the quilt top (pretty side up) (unroll from the middle roller if you used zipper) carefully onto the already basted top edge of the backing/batting. Pin the quilt top about every 6\" like you did the batting. Tighten the belly roller again smoothing the 3 layers and set the brake. Now baste the quilt top onto the backing/batting at the top near the take-up roller.",
        "Remove the pins.The reason I float my quilts is I was finding bunny ears or stretched corners on the bottom of my quilts when I used the zippers on the bottom of the quilt top. The quilting process shrinks or pulls in the quilt as you quilt it. Then when you get to the bottom and the bottom of the quilt top is nailed to the zipper, there can be no pulling in there so it does not seem to match the rest of the quilt. It's really just matter of preference.",
        "I'm sure there is a way to use the zipper without the bunny ears, I just don't know what it is.You are now ready to start quilting. By the way, don't forget to have fun."

        "Behold,\".The word Tenach is written with three letters in Hebrew - Tav, Nun and Kaph (TNK) and is an abbrevation of the three parts of the Hebrew Bible - Torah (law), Neviyim (prophets) and Ketuviym (writings). This Bible has the Hebrew text on one page with a Jewish translation on the other. For those who are learning Hebrew and are looking for a Hebrew Bible this is a good one. This Bible is great for Jews and Christians.",
        "Christians who compare different translations do themselves a diservice by comparing only Christian translations. A Jewish translation will sometimes translate verses differently from a different perspective on the bible.The name Canaan refers to the son of Ham, the son of Noah as well as the descendants of Canaan who settled the land west of the Jordan river. The Hebrew for this name is כנען pronounced kena'an. It is derived from the root כנע (Kena) meaning \"to be brought down by a heavy load\".",
        "By extension this word can also mean subdue or humble. Canaan and his descendents are continually being \"brought down\". Canaan was cursed by Noah and his descendents were subdued and conquered by Israel as God had promised in Deuteronomy 9.",
        "(ASV)The phrase \"Bring down\" is the Hebrew word כנע (Kena) in the context of the conquest of the Canaanites.God used Israel to \"bring down low\" (Kena) the people who are \"brought down low\" (Kena'an).The word כנען (kena'an) can also mean a \"merchant\" as in Hosea 12:7 (verse 8 in the Hebrew Bible) as a merchant is one who carries heavy loads.The Revised Standard Version translation for this passage is \"So God created man in his own image\".",
        "As we shall see, this translation is very Western and is missing the Eastern flavour of the original text. Below is a translation, word for word, followed by a translation reflecting the Eastern meaning.ויברא(vay-yeev-rah)The word ברא (bara) is a verb, literally meaning \"to fatten\" as well as \"to fill\". It is often translated as \"create\" as in this verse as well as in Genesis 1:1 but the concept of \"creating\" is a western abstract and not the true meaning of ברא.",
        "When the י (Y) is prefixed to the verb it identifies the subject of the verb as masculine and singular (he) and the verb tense as imperfect (will fill). The first letter prefixed to the word is the ו (V) meaning \"and\". When this letter is prefixed to a verb it switches the tense of the verb. In this case the perfect tense verb becomes imperfect.",
        "The word ויברא would literally be translated as \"and he filled\".אלהים(eh-lo-hiym)The root of this word is אלוה literally meaning \"strength\" and \"power\" and is usually translated as God or god (a powerful one). The ים is the masculine plural suffix. The word אלהים can be translated as \"gods\" (quantitative plural) or as \"God\" (qualitative plural) in the sense of being a very powerful god.",
        "As this noun follows the verb we know that it is the subject of the verb, the \"he\" in the word ויברא.את(et)This word preceeds a direct object of a verb telling us that the next word is \"what was filled\". This word is a grammatical tool used in Biblical Hebrew and has no equivelant in English and is therefore never translated.האדם(ha-ah-dahm)The first letter, ה (H), is a prefix meaning \"the\". The word אדם (adam) means \"man\" and is also the name of the first man - Adam.",
        "Because it is prefixed by the article ה, we know that this word should be translated as \"man\" rather than Adam.בצלמו(beh-tsahl-mo)The word צלם (tselem, the mem is written as ם when at the end of a word, and as מ otherwise) is an outline or form of an original and comes from the parent root צל (tsal) meaning \"shadow\". A shadow is a also representation of an original. The prefix ב (B) means \"in\" or \"with\".",
        "The suffix ו (O) means \"of him\" or \"his\".Q: Why are some Hebrew words plural but translated in the singular?A: Hebrew plurals can be either quantitative (more than one) or qualitative (great, large, prominent). For example the singular word \"elo'ah\" means God (or more literally mighty one). The plural form is \"elohiym\". This plural form can be more than one god or one great god. In fact, in Genesis 1:1 it says \"in the beginning elohiym (plural) created...\".",
        "In Hebrew the verb matches the verb in number and gender and the Hebrew word behind \"created\" is \"bara\" literally meaning \"he created\" (singular masculine). Therefore, the context of the verse will often indicate whether the noun should be translated as a plural or a singular.Some Hebrew words are always written in the plural form such as paniym (the plural form of paneh) which means \"face\" (probably through the idea of the prominent part of the body).",
        "The word shamayim (heaven) is another example of a word that is always written in the plural.Please feel free to use, copy or distribute any material within the \"Biblical Hebrew E-Magazine\" for non-profit educational purposes only."

        "My first task when I started woodworking was learning how to cut boards to length. I did much research on what type of saw I need and how to use them. After studying the very well-done askwoodman and giant Cypress sites on Japanese saws, I purchased a 12” ryoba saw from Japan Woodworker. Incidentally I do like my Gyokucho Japanese saws, but I now have more or less converted to western hand and back saws except for rough carpentry work.",
        "I spent much time cutting 2x4s into small pieces while I learned to use the ryoba saw.My first project with my newly acquired sawing skills and the collection of tools pictured in my last post was to build a small packing box.This is the initial project presented in The Joiner and Cabinet Maker. The first part of this book by Lost Art Press is a reprinted fictional account of a young woodworking apprentice, Thomas.",
        "Originally published in the early 1800s, the book essentially tells Thomas’ story during his years as an apprentice. Along the way it provides instruction on hand tool woodworking shop practice and three projects, a packing box, a school box, and chest of drawers. The second part of this book is written by Christopher Schwarz and he provides additional description (and analysis) on how to build the three projects presented in the original text.",
        "I was fascinated with the packing box and its simple construction (wood and cut nails) made it an ideal first project for me as well.I did not yet have a bench or dedicated place to work, so I built the project on my back patio using a work surface of two plastic sawhorses with a plywood board on top. My packing box was built from 1/2” yellow-poplar and 4d cut nails. Battens secured the lid boards together and nails through the lid were clinched.",
        "While I felt the box turned out pretty solid and square, two things become apparent very quickly. I needed a work surface that did not slide around as I tried to plane the box joints smooth and I needed a sharper plane iron."

        "Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel were the two premier schools of thought in the century that encompassed the destruction of the second Temple. These schools stemmed from two great thinkers, one strident, the other more insightful, emerged out of the chaos created in the dissolution of the Sanhedrin by Herod.",
        "While their relationship was collegial both contributing to the halachic discourse and enrichment of the community their progenitors as expected, had a more difficult time adjusting to a world where there was no Temple. These two schools of thought different as they were from each other in practice and philosophy had the community’s interest at heart. But beyond that each of them based their halachic positions on a principled understanding of text as well as a passionate love for their people.",
        "I mention this to set the record straight for those who may have read Shmaryahu Rosenberg’s op-ed in the Forward (“A Rabbinic Tea Party Precedent”, September 23, 2011) in which the School of Shammai was portrayed as a collection of delinquents and hooligans.Rosenberg’s op-ed did a great injustice to the School of Shammai.",
        "He has interpreted the actions of that school through the lens of contemporary American politics, comparing the School of Shammai to the Tea Party movement associated with the Republican Party. If nothing else, the School of Shammai was committed to halachic solutions to real problems effecting real people who witnessed the annihilation of their spiritual center. Politics was not on the agenda, nor were they reacting to a groundswell of opinion or a popular movement.",
        "They were principled in their decisions, so much so that the Talmud suggests that until the bat kol (heavenly voice) is heard their point of view is as valid as the School of Hillel. Great scholars were supportive of the School of Shammai as evident by the support of the acclaimed sage Rabbi Tarfon.",
        "The Talmud Bavli (Shabbat 25b) in discussing who is considered a rich man sites Rabbi Tarfon of the School of Shammai who declaimed without chagrin that a rich man is ”one who has a hundred vineyards and a hundred fields and a hundred servants to work them”. This was quite different than the School of Hillel who believed a rich person was one who was satisfied with his lot, however small.",
        "The school of Shammai had no ulterior political or tax motives for saying this, but a sincere literal and lucid understanding of what it meant to be wealthy. The School of Hillel, being more politically correct perhaps of course, saw wealth as a metaphorically.",
        "Needless to say the School of Hillel never defined “rich”, rather defined what it means to be fulfilled or content.Both approaches were acceptable to the sages and it is for this reason that they said not once that “elu v’elu divrei elohim chaim” (both this and that are the words of the living god), meaning that neither Hillel or Shammai have a monopoly on halachic interpretation.",
        "The use of “elu v’elu” referring to both schools would rule out the notion that the School of Shammai were extremists as Rosenberg would have us believe. Ultimately the School of Hillel superseded the School of Shammai perhaps because the bat kol finally came out in Yavne after 70CE in favor of Hillel. Perhaps however there was another reason. The School of Shmmai was noted as understanding text literally while Hillel saw text only through the prism of interpretation, reasonableness and creativity.",
        "Thus when the Torah informs us to read the prayer “shema” when “you lie down and when you rise up” the School of Shammai understood it literally. They believed it should be read in a prone position at night, while the School of Hillel understood it to mean that before you go to sleep read the shema and when you wake in the morning.",
        "One doesn’t have to be in a prone position to read the “shema” according to the School of Hillel but Rabbi Tarfon agreed with Shammai’s rendering of the text and would lie down before reading the “shema”.The difference then between the two Schools was the following: The school of Shammai understood the text literally without the need for interpretation.",
        "The School of Hillel, more creative and imaginative, wished to probe deeper into what the text really meant and what its adherents were supposed to get out of the text. None of this meant that the School of Shammai was abusive or applied physical force to have their way. Rosenberg’s portrayal of the School of Shammai as intolerant and prone to hooliganism as evidenced by one famous instant that he sites is ridiculous.",
        "Of the 350 controversies between the two schools only once was there recorded behavior unbecoming of Talmudic scholars which they were.The two schools emerged as an answer to the vacuum left when under Herod the Sanhedrin was disbanded as stated previously. In addition and no less important, the battles between the Sadducees and the Pharisees were coming to a close with the destruction of the Temple.",
        "The use of the word Pharisee was discouraged and ultimately dropped from usage because of its connotation; the rabbis wishing to end the in fighting known as “sinat chinom” (hateful for no reason) as well as any other forms of derisive behavior. The School of Shammai was part of this effort and to suggest otherwise is misreading Jewish history.",
        "Rosenberg’s reading of Shammai is flawed when he says “what Shammai didn’t understand is that the process of democracy itself has a value far beyond the laws decided through it, and circumventing it leads to extremism and disaster”. Perhaps Shammai didn’t grasp the value of a democratic system “a la” Western Democracy. Of course not.",
        "They were living in the Middle East two thousand years ago in the shadow of a destroyed Temple with hardly any infrastructure left and unprecedented carnage their lives in shambles without a clear grasp of what was to become of them. Their interest wasn’t democratic process; their concern was the very survival of the Jewish people.Tuesday, September 27, 2011Hillel and Shammai RevisitedPosted by Shael Siegel at Tuesday, September 27, 2011Labels: bat kol, hillel, Rabbi Tarfon, shammai, Temple"

        "“A project manager? This has to be a joke. And so started probably the best 6 months of my life.” -Samy, an international student from India and an exchange participant from AIESEC UBC who went for a six-month internship in Bamberg, GermanyThe process leading up to my internship was both long-winded and rocky. I had little idea of what to expect when I got to the tiny town of Bamberg, Germany for a six-month internship.",
        "With rich international travelling experiences, I was used to the life of finding new families and friends in many remote foreign lands. However, Germany was the one captivating place that I haven’t set foot on yet-not until the AIESEC internship opportunity surfaced, and after accepted by the program, I luckily and eventually had a home in Germany to go for a Sunday morning brunch. To be honest, the fact that I am not a German-speaker should have had me petrified about this 6-month internship.",
        "Yet, I guess it was the risk taker in me that, for the same reason, found it thoroughly exciting. When I arrived there I was told to be on a project with another fellow exchange participant from India who would too be my roommate. “Another huge challenge!” I thought so because I wasn’t the type of person that made new friends easily. I was soon proved to be wrong. We became good friends and she was a great stabilizing factor for me during the experience.",
        "I felt much more confident and less homesick being with someone who had a similar cultural background with me, since there were barely any foreigners in the little town, not to mention the friendly yet overwhelming stops and stares we receivedwhile walking on streets. We went into work the second day after arrival, and, surprisingly, were greeted by people from 15 different countries!",
        "That reception was absolutely eye opening and was, without question, an amazing start of my journey.Before taking the exchange, my impressions about an internship were mainly about errand running, something like coffee buying and printing jobs.",
        "However, my first meeting with my boss began with “So you are now the project manager and are responsible for contacting senior executives from our branches in India.” The prospect was daunting and I had no idea if I was even capable of a coffee run without causing massive spillage on my way back. A project manager? This has to be a joke.And so started probably the best 6 months of my life.",
        "I gained the professional skills needed for an international project and often managed to tackle unexpected issues. Most importantly, I now realize that I have more to offer than I could ever imagine, and even with those failures on the way there was always something to learn. The exchange was a wonderful experience in terms of travelling too. I made time for travels almost every weekend and, at the last month of my internship, I was able to explore Portugal, Spain and Italy.",
        "What’s more, I met some truly fantastic people along the way. They constantly inspired me to keep pushing my limits and almost every encounter would bring me a new life lesson. This internship was a concentration of what I would have learnt typically in 3 years–all condensed into 6 months.",
        "It was an “intensive life course”—that is probably the best way I can put it.I do hope that I will be able to have another exchange experience like this soon, and, if not, I am completely satisfied with the chance of having had even one. It truly was the time of my life so far and I recommend anyone who wants a life-changing experience to step on it and to push their own limits. For me, there’s little out there that works better than an experience like this in an unknown foreign land."

University of Pittsburgh researchers conducted four focus groups with 36 women whose ages ranged from 18 to 45.",

We have the solution for creating great results.Below are actual Fuji Transfers done in the light and a darkened room. Can you tell the difference?You will discover that Fuji works similar to the old Polaroid. However, Fuji colors have always been much better and more correct than Polaroid.",
        "For those of you that are having problems with Fuji, the only thingdifferent from Polaroid is that you have to protect the Fuji negative from light only during the transfer process. If you are having any problems with Fuji film, please email sales@daylab.com and we will help you achieve the results you are after.Important Update. The colors of Fuji film are much brighter and truer than Polaroid’s. Fuji also reveals more of the color of the paper it is put on.",
        "To avoid too much yellow, use a whiterpaper or add cyan and magenta filters to your Daylab prior to exposure. This will minimize or eliminate the yellow results some new users are complaining about.You should be happy with any method you have been using with Polaroid film. The only difference is that theFuji Negative is more sensitive to light. Therefore you need to protect the sides from reflective light only when peeling apart. We suggest a box opened from the top.",
        "This solves the problem and makes it easy towork with the negative. Everything else should be the same.Method One using Strathmore Bristol Sheets, Plate SurfaceFuji film has a higher ISO than Polaroid 669. You need to protect the exposed film from light coming from the side when only during the few seconds you are applying it to the art paper. We have posted examples ofimage transfer done in complete roomlight and a darkened room. Attach your hot press paper to a clipboard and set up in desired work area.",
        "Make you image using the Daylab. Immediately after pulling out thefilm, cut off the end with the emulsion. Also cut off the other side of the exposed film set, but be sure to leave about a 1/2 tab. Fold the tab on the side of the original image back against the photo and placethis side against the paper on the clipboard. Insert the tab under the clip along with the paper. At this point, align the paper and image as you desire. Lift up the image and grab the tab that you bent back.",
        "Withyour left hand, place pressure on the top of the clip and with the right hand grab the tab and in one brisk movement separate the positive and negative side of the film. The two will separate and the positive sidecan be thrown away. Use your hand, using little pressure, smooth out the negative side so all of it is lying flat on the paper. Using the brayer roller, apply heavy pressure from the tab to the bottom of the image.Do this motion twice and rotate the clip board 90 degrees.",
        "Repeat this motion twice. Again rotate 90 degrees. Continue this until you have completed a 360 rotation. Release the tab from underneath the clip but keepthe paper attached. Rest the brayer on top of the image near the tab. Apply light pressure and start moving the brayer down the image while simultaneously pulling the negative from the paper. Keep the negative andthe brayer pushed against each other while pulling the image off the paper.Alternative Method Two1.",

Cut-off the top part of the negative/positive set approximately 1 inch above the film set. You can also cut off the bottom, approximately 1/2 below the film set if you want a cleaner transfer.3. We use a clip board for our transfers to make it easier to align the film and art paper but you can do this on any hard surface. Place your choice of paper on the clip board under the clip.",
        "Place thenegative/positive set on top of the paper, with the negative (black side) up and the top 1” under the clip.4. After a total of 15-30 seconds, carefully pull out the positive (white side) while pressing down on the negative. The longer you wait, the better the positive will look for possible emulsion lifts. We have beensuccessful doing this step in daylight by keeping the negative as close to the paper as possible while peeling off the positive.",
        "If you have problems in the beginning with daylight, either dim the lights or work inas dark an environment as possible. The key is to minimize light from the sides.5. Once the positive has been removed, tap down the negative with your fingers to secure in place. Every else can now be done in complete daylight.6. Using your finger tips, apply pressure to the negative and rub across the complete negative to begin the transfer to the paper.7.",
        "Use your roller for approximately 15-30 seconds to press the negative into the paper. It is best to work in one direction only to minimize shifting of the negative.8. After a total of approximately 90 seconds, peel the negative from the art paper by applying pressure with the roller while peeling up the negative against the roller.EMULSION LIFTS2. Allow the negative/positive film set to develop for the full time, approximately 90 seconds.3.",
        "Separate the positive and negative and place the positive in warm water, at least 120 degrees. The hotter the water the quicker the emulsion will separate from the backing but the lower the temperature the easierit is to work with.4. When the emulsion starts to separate, remove the positive to a tray of cool water. Carefully pull off the emulsion which will feel like a large decal. It can then be transferred to the surface you want to place iton .5. The emulsion can be transferred to any surface.",
        "We first coat the receiving surface with MOD PODGE MATTE-MAT (available at Michaels). Carefully place the emulsion on the surface you have coated and manipulate asyou desire. When it dries, you can coat the image to protect it. There are many other adhesives that will work as long as they are not quick drying.Remember this is one of a kind art. Experiment to create your own individual style. If you come up with new techniques, please share them with us by emailingsales@daylab.com . Be patient.",

        "Student Commencement Speech by Sarah R. SmithHello, Class of 1998.Do you remember the Admissions video they sent us about a billion years ago? I have to admit, I loved the scenes from Commencement. Those women looked so grown-up, so beautiful and so proud as they marched along, trying not to look at the camera. The looks on their faces, I thought, how did they get those wise eyes? I wanted to be one them. I wanted to feel how it feels to have completed Wellesley - I wanted to stop feeling so small.",
        "Though today may feel as scary in some ways as the day we left home, I can see the look they had on all your faces. You somehow make these silly hats and robes look regal.A woman I greatly admired my first year told me about the words inscribed on the College shield. Not the famous ones, but another Latin phrase, incipit vita nova. It means, Thus begins a new life. How true, I thought then. And now.",
        "When we stepped onto Wellesley's beautiful landscape for our long Orientation almost four years ago, we might not have been able to imagine the women we have now become, but we knew something big had begun. And our lives became not about reaching today, Commencement, not about completing Wellesley, as I thought when I admired the women in the Admissions video, but working through each day, with the women around us.",
        "Our new lives became about living here, and I think the wiser eyes we have today attest to the part of Wellesley we will take with us tomorrow.What that is, is going to be different for all of us.",
        "Our experiences in and out of the classroom, our accomplishments and our frustrations have intersected countless times; we have affected each other deeply, but we each will make our own meaning of Wellesley.We all know that there are many differences among us, and that they make our unity complex and sometimes difficult. Just as we do out best not to shy away from our differences, I think we should leave here remembering not just the joy of this wonderful place, but its hard times as well.",
        "For these are what have made our experiences here more than a vacation - a long, lazy, sunny stay that soon fades into other peaceful memories.I hope you all have found peaceful moments here, on Lake Day or Spring Weekend or when you finished your theses. Or on any day when you found yourself enjoying life in spite of your cares. I hope we will continue to have those days.But what about the days that came before and after them?",
        "There were struggles large and small - papers, projects, conflicts both personal and public. Those were the hard days. They've made us strong. And the beauty in them is that it's not bad to have hard things to do - in fact, it's good, it's where life happens. My mom has often reminded me that, \"If it were easy, it wouldn't be worth doing.\" It wasn't easy here; it won't be easy when we go.",
        "But that's what makes us proud, whole, and beautiful.We can continue to be this way in the new life that indeed begins today. I encourage you to also keep with you our official motto, not to be served but to serve. Ponder it as you make your new choices. We each can decide how this motto affects our lives. I think our time here has instilled it into each of us - we know that the smallest service can mean the world to another person, and that the most sweeping reform needs to touch the individual.",
        "We know that to serve is one of the harder things in life, but we are not only ready for the challenge, we can appreciate its beauty. It is what makes our new lives less focused on our personal successes: if we listen to it, we give our personal victories meaning in the world. It brings beautiful struggles into our lives, making the hard days the ones to live for.I know this class is going to do wonderful things, for ourselves, for each other and for those things and people we each care deeply about.",
        "Congratulations, Class of 1998. May we have many hard, beautiful days."

        "Once upon a time, Red Dwarf was the funniest television programme ever made. For those not familiar with it, it was a space sci-fi comedy set on a mining ship. The crew were a pedantic hologram, an anally retentive cyborg, a self-obsessed mutant cat and the last known human in the universe: Lister. Although Red Dwarf has dated terribly, one thing which still resonates is Lister’s dream for the future. As the last man standing, what he wanted was simple: to live with his loving family in Bedford Falls.",
        "And who wouldn’t want that? For Bedford Falls is the setting for It’s A Wonderful Life – the most life-affirming, warmly nostalgic film ever made.George Bailey (the amazing James Stewart) is the unsung hero of Bedford Falls. His entire life has been spent putting others first: risking his life to save his brother’s and staying home to manage the Bailey Savings & Loan company following the death of his father.",
        "Having sacrificed his dreams to travel and study, he has sacrificed material wealth in favour of friends and family.Tragically for George, local villain Potter (Lionel Barrymore) is intent on acquiring the Savings & Loan – the only institution in Bedford Falls he doesn’t own. George, of course, is loathe to concede his community-centred business – so Potter sets out to ruin it and force George to give it up.",
        "On Christmas Eve, facing ruin and having let down so many people, George is left broken and desperate.Contemplating suicide on a bridge, he is visited by his loveable guardian angel: the bumbling Clarence (Henry Travers). Clarence shows George how his community would have suffered if he had never been born: a nightmarish alternate reality in which his family have suffered bereavements and insanity and his beloved wife Mary (Donna Reed) is a lonely, childless spinster.",
        "There are obvious parallels to be drawn with Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol as supernatural beings visit the living to convince them of the value of life – and the comparisons are entirely fair and justified.Like A Christmas Carol, It’s A Wonderful Life has a darkness at its heart which provides a key contrast with the lighter, warmer denouement.",
        "George’s descent into despair is brilliantly played by Stewart, casting aside the wholesome image he had previously fostered, before returning again t the amiable and warm persona he had previously enjoyed. Always a witty and affable screen presence, It’s A Wonderful Life is perhaps the greatest demonstration of Stewart’s range and skill.For some, It’s A Wonderful Life is too saccharine sweet. Presumably those people have had their hearts removed and replaced with swinging bricks.",
        "It’s a joyful celebration of family, community and the individual, providing proof that no matter how insignificant you believe yourself, you mean something to somebody. George’s plight and his redemption prove that humanity and goodness are what really matters – a message which society needs reminding of at Christmas time more than ever. It’s a wonderful film."

After discussing the hand with several people, I'm quite sure I should of only lost about 30-50% of my stack. No regrets though, aside from that I think I played well and didn't run particularly well. I didn't play any of the other side events or cash games while I was there.",

We ended up renting a cabana one day, jet skied, clubbed, and ate a bunch of restaurants. I didn't do a whole lot of playing online but that's about to change.",
        "We left Atlantis today and moved into a condo next to the ocean and will be here for about eight days before moving to another condo. The plan is start playing 8 hours a day, six days a week, for the next three to four weeks. I feel motivated to play right now and am really looking forward to getting back in the swing of things. I'm planning on devoting an hour a day to reviewing sessions and studying hands as well. This is something I was doing in the US and I found it extremely beneficial.",
        "Somehow I need to squeeze some exercise into these days and there's no gym here so I'll probably be jogging along the road or beach in our neighborhood. I'm not a big runner, I normally use elliptical machines, so it should be interesting.I should have another update towards the end of the month. Good luck at the tables.Good to see you enjoying the fruits of your labor! Keep it up Tony!- JGThanks Jeff. Hope you're feeling/doing well.",
        "Looking forward to playing some pool when I get back to Cali.How many hands do you play on average over a year on a day to day basis?I'm working 4 days a week and was thinking about doing poker aside for 2000 hands a day.On work days i would like to play 1000-1500 and on free days and make good for what i felt behind.I have grinded a small the last two months on 0.25/0.5 FR and winning on 0.5/1 SH (only 10k hands) but want to move up as fast as possible to 2/4.....realistic goal in your opinion with a job on the side?I play an average of about 1500 hands per day but I'm earning a lot more VPPs than you'd be earning at those limits.I wouldn't want to discourage you but your plan is pretty ambitious.",
        "2,000 hands of fixed limit is a lot, it's not like NL where you can 16 table. At least I can't without sacrificing my win rate. I'd at least give it a try and see what happens but if you see your win rate start dropping off, it may not be worth it.Good luck.Oops, made a mess of it. Sorry for the bad language.I understood it just fine, no worries.Hi Tony. Best of luck in the next few weeks.",
        "As a former runner who recently started up again after a long break, I'd recommend starting with some run / walk combos... Your body will thank you. Running puts a lot of new stresses on your body so it's best to eaze into it.Start with a brisk walk for 4 minutes / run 1 minute / repeat for 30 minutes or however long you want to work out.",
        "Listen to your body and adjust ratios gradually over the course of weeks.This method is much better than just going out and running 3 miles cold turkey, getting injured or so sore that you never want to run again. :)madscoutHey Thanks Ryan and great advice.",
        "I didn't end up doing any running mostly due to laziness but I will take your advice if I do start which is quite possible with all this moving around.What book did you say you had read on running that was really good?\"Born to Run\"That's what I did and it worked very well. I started with the 1:1 walk/run ratio then increased it to 2:2 and 3:3 for the next few weeks before I could finally run for 30 minutes without stopping.If you're going to read a book about running, I strongly recommend 'Once a Runner'.",
        "All of my old college teamates would agree. We passed that around and when it got back to me I read it again.Thanks Eric, I'll check it out"

        "Hello).I thought today you may like to hear a little tale of a blogger with a vision. This is an inspirational journey that a small business owner embarked on based solely on her passion for decorating and determination to help others create beautiful spaces, the same spaces that she creates and is inspired by when she reads her favorite magazines and peruses the blogs of her fellow writers. Meet Jamie Meares, a blogger, decorator and new shop owner of Furbish in Raleigh, North Carolina.",
        "And when I say new, I mean it — she opened on November 21st!I heard about Jamie’s work through Michelle Smith who took the time to write to me recently singing the praises of Furbish and this creative shop owner. Jamie authors the blog, I Suwannee, where she has been writing since January 2007. Through I Suwannee, she started working on e-decorating projects for her readers who were looking for help purchasing and arranging things in their homes.",
        "Jamie then did what few have the courage to, she left her full-time “stable” day job to take the ride of a lifetime – and threw herself straight into decorating full-time. Now think for a moment, you are Jamie, could you imagine yourself taking such a risk? It takes a lot to jump into a new career but when one feels the heart strings pulling, and you suddenly find yourself surrounded by clients asking you to jump ship to work with them instead, well I assume the answer is obvious.",
        "This is what I find so encouraging, though it is risky and not for everyone, but if an opportunity presents itself in a field of work that you’ve dreamed of entering, then why not?And her success story continues – she decided Raleigh needed a little more of her design sensibility in their city since her clients requested furniture and accessories that were not of the mainstream variety, rather those that came from the larger, more affluent design hubs like New York and Atlanta.",
        "And this is where we will begin my interview with Jamie, she’ll be telling you more about her shop and decorating practice…Holly: So Jamie, tell everyone what your store is called and what ultimately made you open it?Jamie: My shop is called Furbish and I decided to open it to fill a niche in Raleigh for the younger set who wants one-of-a-kind painted furniture that’s a little more sexy and edgy that what was currently being offered here (think cottage, shabby chic, distressed white beach house pieces — that’s about all there was).Holly: Many shop owners I’ve met can trace their shop ownership dreams all the way back to their front year lemonade stands… have you always wanted to have a store too?Jamie: Yes!",
        "I’d always had a dream to open a little store, so the time was right – I found the perfect building with a great, sunny, window-lined upstairs for retail, and a huge basement for a workshop/storage for my furniture.Holly: When someone visits Furbish, what can they expect to find?Jamie: I’ve filled the store with my favorite vintage pieces of furniture, new accessories and lighting, artwork from a local painter, my collection of ‘treasures’ accumulated from years of thrifting, ebaying, etc.",
        "For example, lots of vintage decanters, kilim rugs, floral dishes, retro glassware, pillows made from vintage fabric. Rowdy, my schnauzer, works with me and he has a select offering of locally made dog collars he oversees.Holly: And you are a decorator, can you explain how this works?Jamie: I also offering decorating services out of the store, and that’s done really well.",
        "I have my desk right out in the middle of the retail space, with big inspiration boards hanging behind it – and I think it makes approaching an interior decorator, something a lot of my customers would never consider, to be a much more attainable, approachable thing… They’ll sit down at my desk and we’ll talk through an issue they’re having and bam! they’re working with a decorator.Holly: That is a very clever marketing strategy!

They developed a conceptual model of trust (Fig. 1), characterizing how it develops among two parties: a trusting party, called trustor and a party to be trusted, called trustee. This model was then applied to examining the development of employees’ trust in their managers, i. e. upward in hierarchy [ 30‐ 32].",

        "However, Mayer et al.’s model appears to be applicable to trust processes independently of hierarchy [ 32] and provides the opportunity to better understand the supervisor’s decision to entrust a trainee.×Four categories of factors have been identified in a range of studies to influence entrustment decision-making: trainee characteristics, supervisor characteristics, characteristics of the task at hand and contextual factors [ 23‐ 25, 36].",
        "In addition, the relationship between the supervisor and the trainee has been identified as an important category [ 6, 27]. These studies provide a long list of factors in each category, summarized in an overview table by ten Cate et al. [ 2].

Well, if Björk reminded of a spoiled Walt Disney cartoon, the new metamorphoses in Lady Gaga’s wardrobe reminded of Terminator. The Swan Lake turned into a cemetery of cars. From nature to mechanics.",
        "Lady Gaga has always followed contemporary art closely, even if with some years’ delay. The famous meat dress designed by Franc Fernandez and created by Nicola Formichetti was a reference to Vanitas, a 1987 work by Canadian artist Jana Sterbak (when baby Gaga was only 1 year old).Also the new “hard couture” by Miss Germanotta springs from the deep world of contemporary art.",
        "Sometimes the singer almost looks like one of John Chamberlain’s crumpled wrecks, sometimes, instead, she reminds of the visionary craziness of a great performer who became an architect, Vito Acconci. Or again she recalls the recent sculptures of another veteran, Frank Stella. Lady Gaga is a sculpture-singer. Her metamorphoses are proper performances or aesthetic mutations, more than genetic. In her style there’s something “sci-barbaric” – i.e.",
        "barbaric sci-fiction – like in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome starring Mel Gibson and Tina Turner, or Conan the Destroyer starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Grace Jones.Strangely enough, these are all films that recall Sterbak’s works of the mid 80s, which seem to be the mine from which the singer extracts the richness of her identity. Lady Gaga apocalyptically moves up and down the history of art, cinema and performance.",
        "The Dadaists of Zurich’s Cabaret Voltaire come back to life with her, those that with their extreme shows pre-announced the absurdities of WWI. But you can also smell the blood of Viennese Actionism: one of its protagonists, Otto Muehl, stated in 1967 that material action was promising direct pleasure and that it satisfied more than a piece of bread. Don’t be surprised, therefore, if at next Grammy Awards Lady Gaga will arrive dressed like a “Baguette au fromage et jambon”.",
        "Great actionist of the Actionists was also Rudolf Schwarzkogler: his performances consisted of dressing like a dead fish, or a rotten chicken, or covering himself in lighted light-bulbs or in colorful unidentifiable liquids, or again being wrapped in bandages like a mummy in order to mutilate himself later on.But from Lady Gaga we are expecting something more metallic and less organic. The butcher’s season seems to be over and seems not ready for a comeback.",
        "Gaga must definitely have Ron Athey in mind, the super-tattooed and super-pierced American performer. But she could also steal some ideas from Yang Zhichao, a Chinese performance artist that had grass planted on his back or objects implanted in his legs or on his stomach. However, we have the feeling that Lady Gaga does not want anything implanted in her body (anything of permanent, of course), not even as a joke.",
        "Her body is not a territory to conquer, it’s rather a stage on which you can set up a new scenography each time, like another video-artist, Cao Fei, who had a zoological-futuristic imagination.However, can we forget the electric dresses with many light bulbs of different shapes and colors created by Atsuko Tanaka, Japanese artist of the mid 50s? No, we can’t forget them because one day we might find them – once changed and stylistically improved – on our Lady G.",
        "And how not to mention Matthew Barney’s cycle of films Cremaster, the most influential American artist of the late 20th century, a Lady Gaga of the world of art in his own way: with the costumes of his films you could dress an army of Gagas.Are Gaga’s mutations only a summary of the most recent history of performance art, then? Some think so, but they’re wrong. Nowadays artists, from Cattelan to our Lady GG, don’t feel any longer the urgency of reinventing themselves from scratch in order to exist.",
        "They know that they are medium and message at the same time. They are connectors which offer images that were confined to the darkness or that were considered too élite to a wider public, at times a huge one. Few people talked about or remembered Jana Serbak before Lady Gaga appeared wearing an “evening steak”. Performance, even the derived one, sometimes helps discover things that would otherwise get lost in the collective indifference.",
        "Lady Gaga belongs to a generation of mutatis mutandis, that is to say those who build their own identity by changing things that already existed but that needed to be changed in order to continue to exist.

        "They also produce some pretty talented pianists there, apparently churning them out by the all but indistinguishable pair.Or so it seemed Saturday afternoon at the Lesher Center for the Arts, where Chamber Music San Francisco’s Walnut Creek series was brought to a slightly melodramatic but altogether charming close with a piano recital by Michelle and Christina Naughton, 19-year-old identical twins from Madison who are wrapping up their freshman year as full scholarship students at the Curtis Institute of Music.A sister team such as theirs runs the risk of being branded a novelty act, and to be sure, there were elements of some good-hearted, homespun hokum in their presentation.",
        "Twin No. 1, for instance, materialized first, dressed to the nines in a satiny, sleeveless gown of iridescent turquoise, her long, chestnut-brown hair pinned back by a barrette. After introducing herself (“Hi, I’m Michelle”), she dashed off an impressive Mendelssohn Fantasy in F sharp minor, betraying not a whit of timidity at the relentlessly feverish tempos of its third movement and, after one curtain call, disappeared.Next up was Twin No.",
        "2, gliding onstage in a satiny, sleeveless gown of iridescent turquoise, her long chestnut-brown hair — well, you get the picture.",
        "Her equally ingenuous declaration (“Just in case there’s any confusion, I am not Michelle”) was followed by a rendering of Chopin’s Introduction and Rondo in E flat major that was tenderly expressive where it needed to be and lithe and lively as called for.In a very cleverly constructed program, the sisters next demonstrated their prowess at four-handed piano, each occupying her own bench at the Steinway grand to collaborate on Mendelssohn’s Andante and Variations in B flat major and those muscular, rigorous, thoroughly invigorating Six Hungarian Dances from Johannes Brahms.",
        "Here to my mind was the very beating heart of their program.",
        "To see these lovely young women with such obvious affinity both for their music and for each other leaning in together to caress a phrase, drawing back as if one to renew an attack, was nothing short of a revelatory joy.We returned from intermission to find a mahogany Yamaha nestled into the Steinway so the sisters could face each other for Mozart’s Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, begun on the same soft chord and delivered with lovely athleticism and precise articulation and finished off with a scampy little romp of a Molto Allegro.",
        "Next came Brahms’ Variations on a Theme by Haydn, with that majestic St. Antony Chorale tune given its deserved dignity and then treated to every possible permutation of tempo, mood and elaboration. For their closer, the Naughtons chose a more modern piece, Darius Milhaud’s frothy, playful, jazz-inflected Scaramouche, and they flew through it with nimble fingers and a great sense of fun.The recital settled the question of the gimmickry versus the art.",
        "As endearingly awkward as these two were taking turns at the microphone to introduce each piece, the Naughtons at the keyboard were the very picture of poise, professionalism and purity of purpose. They have a great future awaiting them.Reach Sue Gilmore at sgilmore@bayareanewsgroup.com."

        "You sit for months unseen in a corner chair in Howie and Becca Corbett’s living room watching the family wrestle with the unspeakable grief brought about by the loss of a young child.Four-year-old Danny Corbett has been accidentally killed, and if they’re not careful, their conflicting manners of coming to terms with grief (or avoiding it) may destroy the family.If this story were a made-for-television movie, or if it were produced by a less-skilled cast and crew, it would be a gut-wrenching drama, but as performed by Harlequin Productions under the able direction of Brian Tyrrell, it is a strangely quiet production.",
        "Thus the feeling you are sitting in that chair watching the family.“Rabbit Hole” won the Pulitzer Prize in 2007. It was written by David Lindsay-Abaire (“Fuddy Meers” and “Kimberly Akimbo”).",
        "Harlequin’s production stars Megan Kappler as Becca and Jason Haws as her husband, Howie; Melanie Moser as Becca’s sister Izzy; Kathy Dorgan as their mother and Peter Beard as Jason, the high school student who accidentally ran down their son.The set by Jill Carter is the palpably real interior of the Corbett’s living and dining rooms, a kitchen with a fully stocked refrigerator, and Danny’s upstairs bedroom.",
        "The details are impeccable, from their snack foods and laundry to the light in Danny’s room and the light cast on Howie’s face from the television only he watches.In the Broadway production, a revolving set was used. I can’t say for sure because I didn’t see it, but I suspect I would have found that too theatrical.",
        "I like that there were no set changes and no dramatic lighting or music at Harlequin.The only thing remotely theatrical about this production was a little music and dimming of lights for scene changes (lighting by Paul Purvine as nuanced as the acting).Despite intense arguments between each of the characters and emotional breakdowns by both Howie and Becca, I found myself strangely emotionally detached from the action, perhaps because Lindsay-Abaire’s brilliant dialogue and the cast’s nuanced acting avoided all of the usual tricks of tapping into emotion and simply presented real people in a real situation.For example, in the opening scene I thought Becca’s words and expressions were out of sync with one another.",
        "Her words expressed shock and anger as she calmly folded laundry while bantering with Izzy.For a few moments, I wondered why she kept folding that damn laundry, and why her actions didn’t fit her words.",
        "Gradually, it dawned on me that she had shut off all emotion, and that the clothes she was folding belonged to her dead son.That is outstanding writing, directing and acting, and it set the tone for the entire play.While Kappler portrayed Becca’s tightly wrapped grief, Haws portrayed Howie’s grief much differently – abruptly and usually inappropriately shouting at Becca or Izzy and then immediately reining in his anger.Haws typically shines in outsized roles such as John Merrick in “The Elephant Man” or the outlandishly humorous Bottom in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” In this role, he proves that he can play an everyman with controlled intensity.Dorgan is a natural as the meddling mother who, like her daughter, tries unsuccessfully to keep a lid on her emotions.Beard is the quietest and most controlled of all the cast.",
        "He barely speaks, appears shy and painfully polite, and is obviously bottling up his pain.The most animated and most likable of all is Moser as the outlandish sister who also bottles up her pain but under a faade of humor and bravado.This play is definitely not for children. It is anything but light entertainment. There is no hopeful, movie-of-the-week resolution, nothing to mitigate the pain.",

        "The Bigfoot Law: Celebrating 45 Years of Safety2014 marks the 45th anniversary of the Skamania County Sasquatch Refuge. The closest thing to official government recognition the creature has ever had.The year was 1969.",
        "Man achieved its first landing on the moon, The Beatles released Abbey Road, and it became illegal to kill Sasquatch.Courtesy of Guy Edwards, The Bigfoot Lunch ClubSkamania County, Washington is nestled in the center of the Columbia River Gorge, which serves as the dividing line between the states of Washington and Oregon. With towering Douglas Furs, and lush, green wilderness, the people of Skamania County have had a long relationship with the outdoors.",
        "With the population in 1969 of just over 5,000, residents of the region often earned their livelihood from the land.Native American legend of the region tell of hairy, marauding Selahtik Indians, a band of ape like creatures living in the caves along the Cascade Mountain range, murdering and rampaging against all who passed by (often little children).",
        "But 1969 was a far cry away from the Indian legends of the past.The Bigfoot flap of 1969 began in March, when John and Linda Durrell were driving up with their family on a camping trip above Carson, Wa. Nearing their destination, Linda Durrell spotted something of the side of the road.",
        "Getting out to take a look, she was surprised to see extraordinarily large footprints in the snow, far larger than any human could have made.Not quite sure what to do, Linda and family called the local sheriff’s office, who took plaster casts of the footprints for later investigation. They prints measured 22 inches long and 7 ½ inches wide. Investigating the surrounding area, the local deputy found even more footprints.",
        "Pictures of the investigation were featured on the front page of The Columbian newspaper, and the Skamania County Pioneer, and the story was picked up by numerous regional news sources.Media attention around the event was spurred even further when local fisherman Don Cox had an early morning encounter with the creature. Driving towards Bonneville Dam early in the morning of March 5, Cox encountered what he first thought to be a tree in the middle of the road.",
        "Coming closer, he realized it was a huge creature, standing on hind legs, moving quickly across the highway. He watched the creature move quickly across the road, and leap over a 14-foot high embankment on the other side. Stopping off at a local coffee shop, Cox immediately reported the incident to the authorities.Attention caused by the sightings prompted Skamania County to pass what has become known as The Bigfoot Law, making it a felony to kill Sasquatch.",
        "Commissioner Chair Conrad Lundy, Jr., and Prosecuting Attorney Robert Leick signed the ordinance into law. The fact that it was adopted on April 1 did not escape people’s attention.However, City Commissioners maintained that this wasn’t a gag.",
        "“Although this ordinance was adopted on April 1, this is not an April Fool’s Day joke,” Commissioner Lundy told the Skamania County Pioneer at the time, “there is reason to believe that such an animal exists.”The region was featured prominently in an episode of the 1970’s TV show In Search Of… where the city officials involved maintained the legitimacy of passing such an ordinance.",
        "“We didn’t feel that if there was such a creature, and it didn’t do anything to harm anybody, that it didn’t deserve to be harmed or captured.” Said Prosecuting Attorney Robert Leick.The ordinance was reviewed by the county and redefined in 1984, reducing the penalties from $10,000 or 5 years in jail, to $1,000 or 1 year in jail, but the revisions also declared Sasquatch as an endangered species living in Skamania County.",
        "As Prosecuting Attorney Leick summed up, “I think Sasquatches are at least as important as the spotted owl.”Skamania County still receives several Sasquatch sightings a year, and has hosted several Sasquatch related festivals in the past (not to mention a coffee shop)."

        "Unemployment: Canada Adds 12,500 Jobs In April As Rate Holds Steady At 7.2 Per CentYoung Canadians have little to cheer about in the latest jobs report, which showed youth unemployment rising to its highest level in six months even as the overall labour market bounced back slightly from the previous month's slide.Statistics Canada’s April Labour Force Survey revealed employment among youth — those aged 15-24 — fell by 19,000 jobs in April, while the unemployment rate in the age group rose three-tenths of a point to 14.5 per cent.Overall, Canada’s labour market bounced back from a four-year low in March, churning out 12,500 net new jobs — all full-time.",
        "That helped take some of the sting out of March’s massive 54,500-job contraction, though the unemployment rate stayed at 7.2 per cent.Economists noted that young workers were the only demographic counted by Statistics Canada that has not recovered the jobs lost during the recession.April was the third consecutive month in which there was a decline in jobs for youth and the unemployment rate in that demographic edged up to the October 2012 level, the Conference Board of Canada pointed out.High youth unemployment has been a problem since the recession, when about 200,000 jobs for youth disappeared, with few of them coming back, said Pedro Antunes, the board’s director of national and provincial forecasting.“So these latest monthly numbers are just more bad news.",
        "We just haven’t seen this segment of the labour market recover at all,” he said.Antunes said he believes the labour market is fairly tight overall, and he has been starting to hear some organizations complain they are having trouble finding employees in some parts of the country.",
        "The problem appears to be that the jobs they are calling for do not align with what young people have been trained for, he said.“We do suspect that what employers are looking for is not necessarily the skill set that youth have and that’s been the ongoing problem in general since the recession.”There appears to be a correlation between lost part-time jobs and rising youth unemployment as, increasingly, the types of jobs open to young people trend toward temporary, part-time and contract work.“Most of them are employed part-time or not fully employed, certainly,” Antunes said.Youth tend to feel the brunt of a slow economy, Antunes said, because they \"are the least experienced, they have the least tenure and they’re the first to go when there is a cycle, that’s nothing new.",
        "We saw that in 2008-2009 just like we had seen in many previous recessions or slowdowns.\"What’s really surprising about this recession is that it’s been so long-lived for youth. ...",
        "We haven’t seen any recovery in terms of employment for that cohort since the recession and we’re now running four or five years since then,” he said.Erin Weir, an economist.\"Ken Lewenza, president of the Canadian Auto Workers’ union, said he is concerned that the new jobs created have no impact on tamping down “chronically high” youth unemployment.“Government should not allow the economy to limp along at this pace indefinitely — it is a terrible growth and jobs strategy.",
        "Persistently high unemployment in many parts of the country, particularly among young people, requires action on the part of government and industry,” he said in a statement.“In failing to address the problem of high youth unemployment, we’re turning our back on young people struggling to find jobs, pay forever-escalating tuition costs and just get by.”Despite an overall rebound in Canada’s labour market, April's gain wasn’t sufficient to offset the losses of the first three months of the year, leaving Canada about 13,000 jobs short of where employment stood on Jan.",
        "1.Among the positive signs in the report: Some 36,000 full-time jobs were added in the month, mitigated by a 23,600 drop in part-time work. As well, all the net new jobs were employees, rather than in the self-employed category. And the battered manufacturing sector added 20,600 workers, the best month in almost a year.On the negative side, all the gains came in the public sector, with private-sector employers actually shedding 20,000 jobs.",
        "That fact surprised some economists, as Canada's governments are supposed to be in belt-tightening mode and have called on the private sector to stop sitting on cash and start spending to stimulate the economy.—With files from The Canadian Press"

Then accordingly, we apply the notion to the God of our understanding.",

The important fact is that we receive this assistance when we call upon it. And the more our relationship grows with our Higher Power, the more assistance, guidance, direction, and strength that we receive.",

Spirituality produces humility that is the essential component of a successful, and fulfilling recovery.The assistance received from our Higher Power may, or may not be noticeable, but is definite because we always obtain help in one way or the other, as we rely on our Higher Power for assistance.",
        "Our Higher Power will provide us with the skill, but in order to obtain the expected outcome, we must do our part by following the positive motivations given to us. It is always beneficial to remember that throughout our recovery, no matter what happens, our Higher Power will always be understanding, loving, and will always desire to lend a hand on our path.",
